Additionally, a sigma-algebra (σ-algebra) is associated with the event space.</p>
<p>The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.The event space is a collection of subsets of the sample space.<br>A sigma-algebra is a collection of subsets of the sample space.

<h2><span id="markov-chain-monte-carlo-methods">Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods</span></h2><p>The key idea of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is to construct a Markov chain, which is efficient to simulate and has the stationary distribution p.</p>
<h3><span id="markov-chainsstationarityconvergence-markov-propertytime-homogeneous-markov-chains">Markov Chains(Stationarity,convergence), Markov property,time-homogeneous Markov chains</span></h3><p>Intuitively, the Markov property states that future behavior is independent of past states given the present state.</p>
<h3><span id="stationary-distributionaperiodicergodicityfundamental-theorem-of-ergodic-markov-chains">Stationary distribution,aperiodic,Ergodicity,Fundamental theorem of ergodic Markov chains</span></h3><p>After entering a stationary distribution π, a Markov chain will always remain in the stationary distribution.</p>
<p>It can be shown that there exists a unique stationary distribution π if the Markov chain is irreducible, that is, if every state is reachable from every other state with a positive probability when the Markov chain is run for enough steps.</p>
<p>Even if a Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution, it must not converge to it.</p>
<p>In words, a Markov chain is aperiodic iff for every state x, the transition graph has a closed path from x to x with length k for all k ∈ N greater than some k0 ∈ N.</p>
<p>A Markov chain is ergodic iff there exists a t ∈ N0 such that for any x, x′ ∈ S we have p(t)(x′ | x) &gt; 0.</p>
<p>A commonly used strategy to ensure that a Markov chain is ergodic is to add “self-loops” to every vertex in the transition graph.</p>
<p>An ergodic Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution π (with full support) irrespectively of the initial distribution q0. This naturally suggests constructing an ergodic Markov chain such that its stationary distribution coincides with the posterior distribution. If we then sample “sufficiently long”, Xt is drawn from a distribution that is “very close” to the posterior distribution.</p>

<h3><span id="elementary-sampling-methodsmetropolis-hastings-algorithmmetropolis-hastings-theorem-gibbs-sampling">Elementary Sampling Methods,Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm,Metropolis-Hastings theorem, Gibbs Sampling</span></h3><p>A popular example of a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is Gibbs sampling. </p>

Observe that the posterior distribution can always be interpreted as a Gibbs distribution as long as prior and likelihood have full support.</p>
<p>Langevin dynamics adapts the Gaussian proposals of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to search the state space in an “informed” direction. The simple idea is to bias the sampling towards states with lower energy, thereby making it more likely that a proposal is accepted. A natural idea is to shift the proposal distribution perpendicularly to the gradient of the energy function. The resulting variant of Metropolis-Hastings is known as the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) or Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC).</p>
<p>The HMC algorithm is an instance of Metropolis-Hastings which uses momentum to propose distant points that conserve energy, with high acceptance probability.</p>
<h3><span id="path">path</span></h3><p>target: show that the stationary distribution of a Markov chain coincides with the posterior distribution.<br>base: Detailed Balance Equation which shows that A Markov chain that satisfies the detailed balance equation with respect to π is called reversible with respect to π and if the Markov chain is reversible with respect to π then π is a stationary distribution. With posterior distribution p(x) = 1/Z q(x), substitute the posterior for π in the detailed balance equation, we can remove z, so we do not need to know the true posterior p to check that the stationary distribution of our Markov chain coincides with p, it suffices to know the finite measure q. However, until now, this does not allow us to estimate expectations over the posterior distribution. Note that although constructing such a Markov chain allows us to obtain samples from the posterior distribution, they are not independent. Thus, the law of large numbers and Hoeffding’s inequality do not apply, but there is a way to generalize the (strong) law of large numbers to Markov chains, which is Ergodic theorem. </p>
<p>Next we need to consider how to construct Markov chain with the goal of approximating samples from the posterior distribution p. One way is Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, in which we are given a proposal distribution and we use the acceptance distribution to decide whether to follow the proposal. Another way is Gibbs sampling. </p>
<p>MCMC techniques can be generalized to<br>continuous random variables / vectors. Observe that the posterior distribution can always be interpreted as a Gibbs distribution as long as prior and likelihood have full support.</p>

That is, any trajectory regardless of the policy used to obtain it can be used to improve the model of the underlying Markov decision process. In the model-free setting, this not necessarily true.</p>

However, REINFORCE is not guaranteed to find an optimal policy. Even when operating in very small domains, REINFORCE can get stuck in local optima.</p>
