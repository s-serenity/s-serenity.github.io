First, it can be billions of lines of text. It can also be plenty of CSV lines. Some other formats (e.g., Parquet, …) can be binary. We also encountered HFiles in Chapter 6, which are lists of keyvalue pairs. In fact, Hadoop has another such kind of key-value-based format called Sequence File, which is simply a list of key-values, but not necessarily sorted by key (although ordered) and with keys not necessarily unique.</p>
<h3><span id="shards">Shards</span></h3><p>There are several practical motivations for the many-files pattern even in HDFS.</p>
<h3><span id="querying-pattern">Querying pattern</span></h3><p>This is the motivation behind the standard MapReduce pattern: a map-like phase on the entire input, then a shuffle phase on the intermediate data, then another map-like phase (called reduce) producing the entire output</p>
<h2><span id="mapreduce-model">MapReduce Model</span></h2><p>In MapReduce, the input data, intermediate data, and output data are all made of a large collection of key-value pairs (with the keys not necessarily unique, and not necessarily sorted by key). The types of the keys and values are known at compile-time (statically), and they do not need to be the same across all three collections. </p>
<h2><span id="mapreduce-architecture">MapReduce architecture</span></h2><p>On a cluster, the architecture is centralized, just like for HDFS and HBase. In the original version of MapReduce, the main node is called JobTracker, and the worker nodes are called TaskTrackers.</p>
<p>In fact, the JobTracker typically runs on the same machine as the NameNode (and HMaster) and the TaskTrackers on the same machines as the DataNodes (and RegionServers). This is called “bring the query to the data.”</p>
<p>As the map phase progresses, there is a risk that the memory becomes full. But we have seen this before with HBase: the intermediate pairs on that machine are then sorted by key and flushed to the disk to a Sequence File. And as more flushes happen, these Sequence Files can be compacted to less of them, very similarly to HBase’s Log-Structured Merge Trees. When the map phase is over, each TaskTracker runs an HTTP server listening for connections, so that they can connect to each other and ship the intermediate data over to create the intermediate partitions ensuring that the same keys are on the same machines.This is the phase called shuffling. Then, the reduce phase can start. When the reduce phase is completed, each output partition will be output to a shard (as we saw, a file named incrementally) in the output destination (HDFS, S3, etc) and in the desired format.</p>
<p>Note that shuffling can start before the map phase is over, but the reduce phase can only start after the map phase is over.</p>
<h2><span id="mapreduce-input-and-output-formats">MapReduce input and output formats</span></h2><h3><span id="impedance-mismatch">Impedance mismatch</span></h3><p>MapReduce can read its input from files lying in a data lake as well as directly from a database system such as HBase or a relational database management system. MapReduce only reads and writes lists of key-value pairs, where keys may be duplicates and need not appear in order. However, the inputs we considered are not key-value pairs. So we need an additional mechanism that allows MapReduce to interpret this input as key-value pairs. For tables, whereas relational or in a wide column stores, this is relatively easy: indeed, tables have primary keys, consisting of either a single column or multiple columns. Thus, each tuple can be interpreted as a key-value pair.</p>
<h3><span id="mapping-files-to-pairs">Mapping files to pairs</span></h3><p>How do we read a (possibly huge) text file as a list of key-value pairs? The most natural way to do so is to turn each line of text in a key value pair1: the value is the string corresponding to the entire line, while the key is an integer that expresses the position (as a number of characters), or offset, at which the line starts in the current file being read.</p>
<h2><span id="a-few-examples">A few examples</span></h2><h3><span id="counting-words">Counting words</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/10/31/bigdata6/image-3.png" alt="Alt text"><br><img src="/2023/10/31/bigdata6/image-4.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h3><span id="selecting">Selecting</span></h3><p>This is something easily done by having a map function that outputs a subset of its input, based on some predicate provided by the user.<br><img src="/2023/10/31/bigdata6/image-5.png" alt="Alt text"><br>Here we notice that the output of the map phase already gives us the desired result; we still need to provide a reduce function, which is taken trivially as the identity function. This is not unusual (and there are also examples where the map function is trivial, and the reduce function is doing the actual processing).</p>
<h3><span id="projecting">Projecting</span></h3><p>The map function can project this object to an object with less attributes:<br><img src="/2023/10/31/bigdata6/image-6.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h3><span id="mapreduce-and-the-relational-algebra">MapReduce and the relational algebra</span></h3><p>As an exercise, try to figure out how to implement a GROUP BY clause and an ORDER BY clause. What about the HAVING clause? Naturally, executing these queries directly in MapReduce is very cumbersome because of the low-level code we need to write. </p>
<h2><span id="combine-functions-and-optimization">Combine functions and optimization</span></h2><p>In addition to the map function and the reduce function, the user can supply a combine function. This combine function can then be called by the system during the map phase as many times as it sees fit to “compress” the intermediate key-value pairs. Strategically, the combine function is likely to be called at every flush of key-value pairs to a Sequence File on disk, and at every compaction of several Sequence Files into one.</p>
<p>However, there is no guarantee that the combine function will be called at all, and there is also no guarantee on how many times it will be called. Thus, if the user provides a combine function, it is important that they think carefully about a combine function that does not affect the correctness of the output data.</p>
<p>In fact, in most of the cases, the combine function will be identical to the reduce function, which is generally possible if the intermediate key-value pairs have the same type as the output key-value pairs, and the reduce function is both associative and commutative.</p>
<h2><span id="mapreduce-programming-api">MapReduce programming API</span></h2><h3><span id="mapper-classes">Mapper classes</span></h3><p>In Java, the user needs to define a so-called Mapper class that contains the map function, and a Reducer class that contains the reduce function. A map function takes in particular a key and a value. Note that it outputs key-value pairs via the call of the write method on the context, rather than with a return statement.</p>
<h3><span id="reducer-classes">Reducer classes</span></h3><p>A reduce function takes in particular a key and a list of values. Note that it outputs key-value pairs via the call of the write method on the context, rather than with a return statement.</p>
<h3><span id="running-the-job">Running the job</span></h3><p>Finally, a MapReduce job can be created and invoked by supplying a Mapper and Reducer instance to the job. A combine function can also be supplied with the setCombinerClass method. It is also possible to use Python rather than Java, via the socalled Streaming API. The Streaming API is the general way to invoke MapReduce jobs in other languages than Java. </p>
<h2><span id="using-correct-terminology">Using correct terminology</span></h2><h3><span id="functions">Functions</span></h3><p>A map function is a mathematical, or programmed, function that takes one input key-value pair and returns zero, one or more intermediate key-value pairs.</p>
<p>A reduce function is a mathematical, or programmed, function that takes one or more intermediate key-value pairs and returns zero, one or more output key-value pairs.</p>
<p>A combine function is a mathematical, or programmed, function that takes one or more intermediate key-value pairs and returns zero, one or more intermediate key-value pairs.</p>
<p>Note that the combine function is an optional local aggregation step that occurs before shuffling and sorting, and its purpose is to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred to the reducers. The reduce function, on the other hand, performs the final aggregation and processing based on keys. </p>
<h3><span id="tasks">Tasks</span></h3><p>A map task is an assignment (or “homework”, or “TODO”) that consists in a (sequential) series of calls of the map function on a subset of the input.</p>
<p>A reduce task is an assignment that consists in a (sequential) series of calls of the reduce function on a subset of the intermediate input.</p>
<p>We insist that the calls within a task are sequential, meaning that there is no parallelism at all within a task.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a combine task. Calls of the combine function are not planned as a task, but is called ad-hoc during flushing and compaction.</p>
<h3><span id="slots">Slots</span></h3><p>The map tasks are processed thanks to compute and memory resources (CPU and RAM). These resources are called map slots. One map slot corresponds to one CPU core and some allocated memory. The number of map slots is limited by the number of available cores. Each map slot then processes one map task at a time, sequentially. The resources used to process reduce tasks are called reduce slots. So, there is no parallelism either within one map slot, or one reduce slot. In fact, parallelism happens across several slots.</p>
<h3><span id="phases">Phases</span></h3><p>The map phase thus consists of several map slots processing map tasks in parallel. </p>
<h3><span id="blocks-vs-splits">blocks vs. splits</span></h3><p>HDFS blocks have a size of (at most) 128 MB. In every file, all blocks but the last one have a size of exactly 128 MB. Splits, however, only contain full records: a key-value pair will only belong to one split (and thus be processed by one map task).</p>

<h2><span id="the-json-information-set">The JSON Information Set</span></h2><p>The appropriate abstraction for any JSON document is a tree. The nodes of that tree, which are JSON logical values, are naturally of six possible kinds: the six syntactic building blocks of JSON.</p>
<p>These are the four leaves corresponding to atomic values:Strings, Numbers,Booleans, Nulls. As well as two intermediate nodes: Objects, Arrays. These nodes are generally called information items and form the logical building blocks of the model, called information set.</p>
<h2><span id="the-xml-information-set">The XML Information Set</span></h2><p>A fundamental difference between JSON trees and XML trees is that for JSON, the labels (object keys) are on the edges connecting an object information item to each one of its children information items. In XML, the labels (these would be element and attribute names) are on the nodes (information items) directly.</p>
<p>In XML, there are many more information items: Document information items, Element, Attribute, Character, Comment, Processing instruction, Name space, Unexpanded entity reference, DTD, Unparsed entity, Notation. Here we only focus on documents, elements, attributes, and characters.</p>
<h2><span id="validation">Validation</span></h2><p>Once documents, JSON or XML, have been parsed and logically abstracted as a tree in memory, the natural next step is to check for further structural constraints.</p>
<p>In a relational database, the schema of a table is defined before any data is populated into the table. Thus, the data in the table is guaranteed, at all times, to fulfil all the constraints of the schema. The schema was enforced at write time (schema on write). A collection of JSON and XML documents out there can exist without any schema and contain arbitrary structures. Validation happens “ex post,” that is, only after reading the data (schema on read).</p>
<p>JSON and XML documents undergo two steps: a well-formedness check: attempt to parse the document and construct a tree representation in memory;(if the first step succeeded) a validation check given a specific schema. Note that, unlike well-formedness, validation is schema dependent: a given well-formed document can be valid against schema A and invalid against schema B.</p>
<h2><span id="item-types">Item types</span></h2><p>A fundamental aspect of validation is the type system. A well-designed type system, in turn, allows for storing the data in much more efficient, binary formats tailored to the model.</p>
<h3><span id="atomic-types">Atomic types</span></h3><p>Atomic types correspond to the leaf of a tree data model: these are types that do not contain any further nestedness. The kinds of atomic types available are also relatively standard and common to most technologies. Also, all atomic types have in common that they have a logical value space and a lexical value space.</p>
<p>An atomic type also has a (not necessarily injective) mapping from its lexical value space to its logical value space (e.g., mapping the hexadecimal literal x10 to the mathematical integer sixteen).<br>Atomic types can be in a subtype relationship: a type is a subtype of another type if its logical value space is a subset of the latter.</p>
<h4><span id="strings">Strings</span></h4><p>In “pure computer science” textbooks, strings are often presented as structured values rather than as atomic values because of their complexity on the physical layer. However, for us data scientists, strings are atomic values.</p>
<h4><span id="numbers-integers">Numbers: integers</span></h4><p>Integers correspond to finite cardinalities (counting) as well as their negative counterparts. In older programming languages, support for integers used to be bounded. However, in modern databases, it is customary to support unbounded integers. Engines can optimize computations for small integers, but might become less efficient with very large integers.</p>
<h4><span id="numbers-decimals">Numbers: decimals</span></h4><p>Decimals correspond to real numbers that can be written as a finite sequence of digits in base 10, with an optional decimal period.</p>
<h4><span id="numbers-floating-point">Numbers: floating-point</span></h4><p>Support for the entire decimal value space can be costly in performance. In order to address this issue, a floating-point standard (IEEE 754) was invented and is still very popular today.</p>
<p>Floating-point numbers are limited both in precision and magnitude (both upper and lower) in order to fit on 32 bits (float) or 64 bits (double). Floats have about 7 digits of precision and their absolute value can be between roughly 10^−37 and 10^37, while doubles have 15 digits of precision and their absolute value can be between roughly 10^−307 and 10^308.</p>
<h4><span id="booleans">Booleans</span></h4><p>The logical value space for the Boolean type is made of two values: true and false as in NoSQL queries, two-valued logic is typically assumed.</p>
<h4><span id="dates-and-times">Dates and times</span></h4><p>Dates are commonly using the Gregorian calendar (with some technologies possibly supporting more) with a year (BC or AD), a month and a day of the month. Times are expressed in the hexagesimal (60) basis with hours, minutes, seconds, where the seconds commonly go all the way to microseconds (six digits after the decimal period). Datetimes are expressed with a year, a month, a day of the month, hours, minutes and (decimal) seconds.</p>
<p>Timestamp values are typically stored as longs (64-bit integers) expressing the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 by convention.</p>
<p>XML Schema, JSound and JSONiq follow the ISO 8601 standard, where lexical values look like so (with many parts optional): 2022-08-07T14:18:00.123456+02:00.</p>
<h4><span id="durations">Durations</span></h4><p>The lexical representation can vary, but there is a standard defined by ISO 8601 as well, starting with a P and prefixing sub-day parts with a T.<br>4 days, 3 hours, 2 minutes and 1.123456 seconds: P4DT3H2M1.123456S.</p>
<h4><span id="binary-data">Binary data</span></h4><p>Binary data is, logically, simply a sequence of bytes. There are two main lexical representations used in data: hexadecimal and base64. Hexadecimal expresses the data with two hexadecimal digits per byte. Base 64, formally, does the same but in the base 64, which “wastes” less lexical space in the text. It does so by encoding the bits six by six, encoding each sequence of six bits with one base-64 digit.</p>
<h4><span id="null">Null</span></h4><p>A schema can either allow, or disallow the null value.<br>XML also supports null values, but calls them “nil” and does so with a special attribute and no content rather than with a lexical representation</p>
<h3><span id="structured-types">Structured types</span></h3><h4><span id="lists">Lists</span></h4><p>Lists correspond to JSON arrays and are ordered sequences of (atomic or structured) values.</p>
<h4><span id="records">Records</span></h4><p>Records, or structs, correspond to JSON objects and are maps from strings to values.</p>
<h4><span id="maps">Maps</span></h4><p>Maps (not be confused with records, which are similar) are maps from any atomic value to any value, i.e., generalize objects to keys that are not necessarily strings (e.g., numbers, dates, etc).<br>With a schema, it is possible to restrict the type of the keys, as well as the type of the values. However, unlike records, the type of the values must be the same for all keys.</p>
<h4><span id="sets">Sets</span></h4><p>Sets are like lists, but without any specific ordering, and without duplicate values.</p>
<h4><span id="xml-elements-and-attributes">XML elements and attributes</span></h4><p>XML Schema stands apart from most other technologies and formats, in that it does not offer specific support for records and maps; it offers some limited support for lists, but considers them to be simple types, which are “inbetween” atomic types and structured types. n XML Schema, structure is obtained, instead, with elements and attributes, and the machinery for elements and attributes is highly specific to XML.</p>
<h4><span id="type-names">Type names</span></h4><p><img src="/2023/10/25/bigdata5/image.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h2><span id="sequence-types">Sequence types</span></h2><h3><span id="cardinality">Cardinality</span></h3><p>Many type system give options regarding the number of occurrences of items in a sequence.</p>
<h3><span id="collections-vs-nested-lists">Collections vs. nested lists</span></h3><p>A collection of items is on the outer level, and can be massively large (billions, trillions of items).</p>
<p>A list (or array) of items, however, usually refers to a nested structure, for example an array nested inside a document or object. Such lists of items are usually restricted in size for reasons of performance and scalability.</p>
<p>It is thus important to keep this subtle difference in mind, in particular, do not confuse a collection of integers with a collection that contains a single array of integers.</p>
<h2><span id="json-validation">JSON validation</span></h2><h3><span id="validating-flat-objects">Validating flat objects</span></h3><p>JSound is a schema language that was designed to be simple for 80% of the cases, making it particularly suitable in a teaching environment.It is independent of any programming language.JSON Schema is another technology for validating JSON documents. The available JSON Schema types are string, number, integer, boolean, null, array and object.</p>
<p>An example for a json document is like:<br>{ “name” : “Einstein”, “first” : “Albert”, “age” : 142 }<br>The JSound and the JSON Schema are as follows:<br>{ “name” : “string”, “first” : “string”, “age” : “integer” }</p>
<p>{ “type” : “object”, “properties” : { “name” : “string”, “first” : “string”, “age” : “number” } }.</p>
<p>The type system of JSON Schema is thus less rich than that of JSound, but extra checks can be done with so-called formats, which include date, time, duration, email, and so on including generic regular expressions.</p>
<h3><span id="requiring-the-presence-of-a-key">Requiring the presence of a key</span></h3><p>It is possible to require the presence of a key by adding an exclamation mark in JSound. The equivalent JSON Schema uses a “required” property associated with the list of required keys to express the same.</p>
<h3><span id="open-and-closed-object-types">Open and closed object types</span></h3><p>In the JSound compact syntax, extra keys are forbidden. The schema is said to be closed. There are ways to define JSound schemas to allow arbitrary additional keys (open schemas), with a more verbose syntax. Unlike JSound, in JSON Schema, extra properties are allowed by default. JSON Schema then allows to forbid extra properties with the “additionalProperties” property.</p>
<h3><span id="nested-structures">Nested structures</span></h3><p>{ “numbers” : [ “integer” ] }<br>Every schema can be given a name, turning into a type.<br>JSound allows for the definition not only of arbitrary array and object types, but also user-defined types.</p>
<h3><span id="primary-key-constraints-allowing-for-null-default-values">Primary key constraints, allowing for null, default values</span></h3><p>There are a few more features available in the compact JSound syntax (not in JSON Schema) with the special characters @, ? and =. The question mark (?) allows for null values.  The arobase (@) indicates that one or more fields are primary keys for a list of objects that are members of the same array. The equal sign (=) is used to indicate a default value that is automatically populated if the value is absent.</p>
<p>Note that validation only checks whether lexical values are part of the type’s lexical space.</p>
<h3><span id="accepting-any-values">Accepting any values</span></h3><p>Accepting any values in JSound can be done with the type “item”, which contains all possible values. In JSON Schema, in order to declare a field to accept any values, you can use either true or an empty object in lieu of the type. JSON Schema additionally allows to use false to forbid a field. </p>
<h3><span id="type-unions">Type unions</span></h3><p>In JSON Schema, it is also possible to combine validation checks with Boolean combinations. JSound schema allows defining unions of types with the vertical bar inside type strings, like so: “string|array”. </p>
<h3><span id="type-conjunction-exclusive-or-negation">Type conjunction, exclusive or, negation</span></h3><p>In JSON Schema only (not in JSound), it is also possible to do a conjunction (logical and), as well as exclusive or (xor), as well as negation.</p>
<h2><span id="xml-validation">XML validation</span></h2><h3><span id="simple-types">Simple types</span></h3><p>All elements in an XML Schema are in a namespace, the XML Schema namespace. It is recommended to stick to the prefix xs, or xsd, which is also quite popular. We do not recommend declaring the XML Schema namespace as a default namespace, because it can create confusion in several respects.</p>
<p>The list of predefined atomic types is the same as in JSound, except that in XML Schema, all these predefined types live in the XML Schema namespace and thus bear the prefix xs as well.</p>
<h3><span id="builtin-types">Builtin types</span></h3><p>XML Schema allows you to define user-defined atomic types, for example restricting the length of a string to 3 for airport codes, and then use it with an element.</p>
<h3><span id="complex-types">Complex types</span></h3><p>It is also possible to constrain structures and the element/attribute/text hierarchy with complex types applying to element nodes.<br>There are four main kinds of complex types:• complex content: there can be nested elements, but there can be no text nodes as direct children. • simple content: there are no nested elements: just text, but attributes are also possible. • empty content: there are neither nested elements nor text, but attributes are also possible. • mixed content: there can be nested elements and it can be intermixed with text as well.</p>
<h3><span id="attribute-declarations">Attribute declarations</span></h3><p>Finally, all types of content can additionally contain attributes. Attributes always have a simple type.</p>
<h3><span id="anonymous-types">Anonymous types</span></h3><p>Finally, it is not mandatory to give a name to all types. Be careful: if there is neither a type attribute nor a nested type declaration, then anything is allowed! </p>
<h3><span id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</span></h3><p>Finally, XML Schema documents are themselves XML documents, and can thus be validated against a “schema or schemas”, itself written as an XML Schema.This schema has the wonderful property of being valid against itself.</p>
<h2><span id="data-frames">Data frames</span></h2><h3><span id="heterogeneous-nested-datasets">Heterogeneous, nested datasets</span></h3><p>The beauty of the JSON data model is that, unlike the relational model and the CSV syntax, it supports nested, heterogeneous datasets, while also supporting as a particular case flat, homogeneous datasets.</p>
<h3><span id="dataframe-visuals">Dataframe visuals</span></h3><p>There is a particular subclass of semi-structured datasets that are very interesting: valid datasets, which are collections of JSON objects valid against a common schema, with some requirements on the considered schemas. The datasets belonging to this particular subclass are called data frames, or dataframes.</p>
<p>Specifically, for the dataset to qualify as a data frame, firstly, we forbid schemas that allow for open object types. secondly, we forbid schemas that allow for object or array values to be too permissive and allow any values. We, however, include schemas that allow for null values and/or absent values. Relational tables are data frames, while data frames are not necessarily relational tables. Data frames are a generalization of (normalized) relational tables allowing for (organized and structured) nestedness.</p>
<h2><span id="exercies">exercies</span></h2><p>complextType cannot contain character by default but with mixed=”true” it can.</p>
<h3><span id="protobuf">protobuf</span></h3><p>convert json-like data to columnar representation(why we want this: make it more efficient to get relevant data rather than get the whole table).</p>
<p>convert the columnar representation back to the original format. Replace the missing field with NULL. It’s a “lossless” conversion.</p>

<h2><span id="why-wide-column-stores">Why wide column stores</span></h2><p>A wide column store will be more tightly integrated with the parallel data processing systems.<br>wide column stores have a richer logical model than the simple key-value model behind object storage. wide column stores also handle very small values (bytes and kBs) well thanks to batch processing.</p>
<h2><span id="different-from-rdbms">different from RDBMS</span></h2><p>It does not have any data model for values, which are just arrays of bytes; since it efficiently handles values up to 10 MB, the values can be nested data in various formats, which breaks the first normal form; tables do not have a schema; there is no language like SQL, instead the API is on a lower level and more akin to that of a key-value store; tables can be very sparse, allowing for billions of rows and millions of columns at the same time; this is another reason why data stored in HBase is denormalized. </p>
<h2><span id="bigtable-and-hbase">BigTable and HBase</span></h2><h3><span id="rationale">Rationale</span></h3><p>HBase is an open-source equivalent to the BigTable as part of the Hadoop ecosystem.<br>The data model of HBase is based on the realization that joins are expensive, and that they should be avoided or minimized on a cluster architecture.</p>
<p>The second design principle underlying HBase is that it is efficient to store together what is accessed together. In the big picture, this is a flavor of batch processing, one of the overarching principles in Big Data. Batch processing reduces the impact of latency.</p>
<h3><span id="tables-and-row-ids">Tables and row IDs</span></h3><p>From an abstract perspective, HBase can be seen as an enhanced keyvalue store, in the sense that:a key is compound and involves a row, a column and a version;values can be larger (clobs, blobs), up to around 10 MB; keys are sortable. </p>
<p>A row ID is logically an array of bytes, although there is a library to easily create row ID bytes from specific primitive values. In HBase, the key identifying every cell consists of: the row ID, the column family, the column qualifier, the version.</p>
<h3><span id="column-families">Column families</span></h3><p>The other attributes, called columns, are split into so-called column families. This is a concept that does not exist in relational databases and that allows scaling the number of columns.</p>
<h3><span id="column-qualifiers">Column qualifiers</span></h3><p>Columns in HBase have a name (in addition to the column family) called column qualifier, however unlike traditional RDBMS, they do not have a particular type. Column qualifiers are arrays of bytes (rather than strings), and as for row IDs, there is a library to easily create column qualifiers from primitive values. Unlike the values which can be large arrays of bytes (blobs), it is important to keep column families and column qualifiers short, because as we will see, they are repeated a gigantic number of times on the physical layer.</p>
<h3><span id="versioning">Versioning</span></h3><p>HBase generally supports versioning, in the sense that it keeps track of the past versions of the data. As we will see, this is implemented by associating any value with a timestamp, also called version, at which it was created (or deleted).Users can also override timestamps with a value of their choice to have more control about versions.</p>
<h2><span id="logical-queries">Logical queries</span></h2><p>HBase supports four kinds of low-level queries: get, put, scan and delete. Unlike a traditional key-value store, HBase also supports querying ranges of row IDs and ranges of timestamps.</p>
<p>HBase offers a locking mechanism at the row level, meaning that different rows can be modified concurrently, but the cells in the same row cannot: only one user at a time can modify any given row.</p>
<h2><span id="physical-architecture">Physical architecture</span></h2><h3><span id="partitioning">Partitioning</span></h3><p>A table in HBase is physically partitioned in two ways: on the rows and on the columns. The rows are split in consecutive regions. Each region is identified by a lower and an upper row key, the lower row key being included and the upper row key excluded. A partition is called a store and corresponds to the intersection of a region and of a column family.<br><img src="/2023/10/17/bigdata4/image-1.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h3><span id="network-topology">Network topology</span></h3><p>HBase has exactly the same centralized architecture as HDFS. The HMaster and the RegionServers should be understood as processes running on the nodes, rather than the nodes themselves. The HMaster assigns responsibility of each region to one of the RegionServers. There is no need to attribute the responsibility of a region to more than one RegionServer at a time because, as we will see soon, fault tolerance is already handled on the storage level by HDFS. If a region grows too big, for example because of many writes in the same row ID interval, then the region will be automatically split by the responsible RegionServer. If a RegionServer has too many regions compared to other RegionServers, then the HMaster can reassign regions to other RegionServers.</p>
<h3><span id="physical-storage">Physical storage</span></h3><p>The store is, physically, nothing less than a set of cells. Each cell is thus handled physically as a key-value pair where the key is a (row ID, column family, column qualifier, version) tuple. All the cells within a store are eventually persisted on HDFS, in files that we will call HFiles.</p>
<p>An HFile is, in fact, nothing else than a (boring) flat list of KeyValues, one per cell. What is important is that, in an HFile, all these KeyValues are sorted by key in increasing order, meaning, first sorted by row ID, then by column family (trivially unique for a given store), then by column qualifier, then by version (in decreasing order, recent to old). This means that all versions of a given cell that are in the same HFile are located together, and one of the cells (within this HFile) is the latest. If we zoom in at the bit level, a KeyValue consists in four parts: The length of the keys in bits (this length is encoded on a constant, known number of bits) • The length of the value in bits (this length is encoded on a constant, known number of bits) • The actual key (of variable length) • The actual value (of variable length). Why do we not just store the key and the value? This is because their length can vary. If we do not know their length, then it is impossible to know when they stop just looking at the bits.<br><img src="/2023/10/17/bigdata4/image-2.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>KeyValues, within an HFile, are organized in blocks. But to not confuse them with HDFS blocks, we will call them HBlocks. HBlocks have a size of 64 kB, but this size is variable: if the last KeyValue goes beyond this boundary, then the HBlock is simply longer and stops whenever the last KeyValue stops. The HFile then additionally contains an index of all blocks with their key boundaries. This separate index is loaded in memory prior to reading anything from the HFile.</p>
<h3><span id="log-structured-merge-trees">Log-structured merge trees</span></h3><p>When accessing data, HBase needs to generally look everywhere for cells to potentially return: in every HFile, and in memory. As long as there is room in memory, freshly created cells are added in memory. At some point, the memory becomes full (or some other limits are reached). When this happens, all the cells need to be flushed to a brand new HFile. Upon flushing, all cells are written sequentially to a new HFile in ascending key order, HBlock by HBlock, concurrently building the index structure. When cells are added to memory, they are added inside a data structure that maintains them in sorted order (such as tree maps) and then flushing is a linear traversal of the tree.</p>
<p>What happens if the machine crashes and we lose everything in memory? We have a so-called write-ahead-log for this. Before any fresh cells are written to memory, they are written in sequential order (append) to an HDFS file called the HLog. There is one HLog per RegionServer. A full write-ahead-log also triggers a flush of all cells in memory to a new HFile. If there is a problem and the memory is lost, the HLog can be retrieved from HDFS and “played back” in order to repopulate the memory and recreate the sorting tree structure.</p>
<p>After many flushes, the number of HFiles to read from grows and becomes impracticable. For this reason, there is an additional process called compaction that takes several HFiles and outputs a single,merged HFile. Since the cells within each HFile are already sorted, this can be done in linear time, as this is essentially the merge part of the merge-sort algorithm. Compaction is not done arbitrarily but follows a regular, logarithmic pattern. When the memory is flushed again, an standard-size HFile is written and the two standard-size HFiles are immediately compacted to a double-size HFile.</p>
<h2><span id="additional-design-aspects">Additional design aspects</span></h2><h3><span id="bootstrapping-lookups">Bootstrapping lookups</span></h3><p>In order to know which RegionServer a client should communicate with to receive cells corresponding to a specific region, there is a main, big lookup table that lists all regions of all tables together with the coordinates of the RegionServer in charge of this region as well as additional metadata. </p>
<h3><span id="caching">Caching</span></h3><p>In order to improve latency, cells that are normally persisted to HFiles (and thus no longer in memory) can be cached in a separate memory region, with the idea of keeping in the cache those cells that are frequently accessed.</p>
<h3><span id="bloom-filters">Bloom filters</span></h3><p>HBase has a mechanism to avoid looking for cells in every HFile. This mechanism is called a Bloom filter. It is basically a black box that can tell with absolute certainty that a certain key does not belong to an HFile, while it only predicts with good probability (albeit not certain) that it does belong to it.</p>
<h3><span id="data-locality-and-short-circuiting">Data locality and short-circuiting</span></h3><p>When a RegionServer flushes cells to a new HFile, a replica of each (HDFS) block of the HFile is written, by the DataNode process living on the same machine as the RegionServer process, to the local disk. This makes accessing the cells in future reads by the RegionServer extremely efficient, because the RegionServer can read the data locally without communicating with the NameNode: this is known as short-circuiting in HDFS.</p>
<h2><span id="using-habse">using Habse</span></h2><p>After installing Hbase, we can use Hbase shell. There are some commands in hbase shell: get, scan.<br>We can use filters with scan to query and filter data.</p>
<h2><span id="exercises">exercises</span></h2><h3><span id="bloom-filter">bloom filter</span></h3><p>perfect hash function should have uniform probability.<br>all hash functions set a bit to 1 = collide at the same place: probability of a FP case<br>deleting only happens when compacting.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\hat{w}_\mathrm{ls}\doteq\arg\min_{\boldsymbol{w}\in\mathbb{R}^d}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\boldsymbol{w}^\top\boldsymbol{x}_i)^2=\arg\min_{\boldsymbol{w}\in\mathbb{R}^d}\|\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{w}\|_2^2,</script><p>A slightly different estimator is used for ridge regression:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\hat{w}_{\mathrm{ridge}}\doteq\arg\min_{w\in\mathbb{R}^d}\|y-Xw\|_2^2+\lambda\|w\|_2^2</script><p>As the formula shows, the squared $l_2$ regularization term $\lambda|w|_2^2$ penalizes large $w$ and thus reduces the complexity of the resulting model,so Ridge regression is more robust than standard linear regression in the presence of multicollinearity. Multicollinearity occurs when multiple independent inputs are highly correlated. In this case, their individual effects on the predicted variable cannot be estimated well. Classical linear regression is highly volatile to small input changes. The regularization of ridge regression reduces this volatility by introducing a bias on the weights towards 0.</p>
<h2><span id="uncertainty">uncertainty</span></h2><p>In practice, our data D is merely a sample of the process we are modeling. In these cases, we are looking for models that generalize to unseen data.<br>Therefore, it is useful to express the uncertainty about our model due to the lack of data. This uncertainty is commonly referred to as the epistemic uncertainty.<br>Usually, there is another source of uncertainty called aleatoric uncertainty, which originates directly from the process that we are modeling. This uncertainty is the noise in the labels that cannot be explained by the inputs.</p>
<h2><span id="weight-space-view">Weight-space View</span></h2><p>The most immediate and natural Bayesian interpretation of linear regression is to simply impose a prior on the weights $w$.</p>
<p>Assume that prior $w\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_p^2I)$ and likelihood $y_i\mid x_i,w\sim\mathcal{N}(w^\top x_i,\sigma_n^2).$ are both Gaussian, we will get the posterior distribution over the weights as:</p>

\end{aligned}</script><p>As the above is a quadratic form in $w$, it follows that the posterior distribution is a Gaussian.<br>This also shows that Gaussians with known variance and linear likelihood are self-conjugate. A distribution is said to be self-conjugate (or a conjugate prior is self-conjugate) if, when used as a prior distribution, it results in a posterior distribution that belongs to the same family of distributions. It can be shown more generally that Gaussians with known variance are self-conjugate to any Gaussian likelihood. For general distributions the posterior will not be closed-form. This is a very special property of Gaussians.<br>We can compute the MAP estimate for the weights,</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{gathered}
\hat{w}_{\mathrm{MAP}} =\underset{w}{\operatorname*{\arg\max}}\log p(y_{1:n}\mid x_{1:n},w)+\log p(w) \\
=\arg\min_w\|y-Xw\|_2^2+\frac{\sigma_n^2}{\sigma_p^2}\|w\|_2^2. 
\end{gathered}</script><p>we can find that this is simply the MLE loss with an additional $l_2$ regularization term and this coincides with the optimization objective of ridge regression with weight decay $\lambda=\frac{\sigma_n^2}{\sigma_p^2}$. Also, recall that the MAP estimate corresponds to the mode of the posterior distribution, which in the case of a Gaussian is simply its mean.(The mode of a probability distribution is the value where the distribution reaches its maximum point. In the context of the posterior distribution, the mode corresponds to the most probable value of the parameter given the observed data.).</p>
<p>A commonly used alternative to ridge regression is the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (or lasso), which uses $l_1$ regularization.It turns out that lasso can also be viewed as Bayesian learning, using a Laplace prior.</p>
<p>Note that using point estimates like the MAP estimate does not quantify uncertainty in the weights. The MAP estimate simply collapses all mass of the posterior around its mode.This is especially harmful when we are unsure about the best model.</p>
<h2><span id="recursive-bayesian-updates">Recursive Bayesian Updates</span></h2><p>As data arrives online (i.e., in “real-time”), we can obtain the new posterior and use it to replace our prior.</p>
<h2><span id="non-linear-regression">Non-linear Regression</span></h2><p>We can use linear regression not only to learn linear functions. The trick is to apply a non-linear transformation $\phi:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^e$.<br>In Polynomial regression, to learn polynomials of degree m in d input dimensions, we need to apply the nonlinear transformation</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)& =[1,x_1,\ldots,x_d,x_1^2,\ldots,x_d^2,x_1\cdot x_2,\ldots,x_{d-1}\cdot x_d,  \\
&x_{d-m+1}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot x_d].
\end{aligned}</script><p>the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially in the degree of polynomials and input dimensions. Even for relatively small m and d, this becomes completely unmanageable.</p>
<h2><span id="function-space-view">Function-space View</span></h2><p>Previously, we have been interpreting it as a distribution over the weights $w$ of a linear function $\hat{f}=\boldsymbol{\Phi}w.$, we can equivalently consider a distribution directly over the estimated function values. Instead of considering a prior over the weights${w\sim\mathcal{N}}(0,\sigma_p^2I)$, we now impose a prior directly on the values of our model at the observations.Using that Gaussians are closed under linear maps, we obtain the equivalent prior:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
f\mid X\sim\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\Phi}\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{w}],\boldsymbol{\Phi}\mathrm{Var}[\boldsymbol{w}]\boldsymbol{\Phi}^\top)=\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0},\underbrace{\sigma_p^2\boldsymbol{\Phi}\boldsymbol{\Phi}^\top}_{\boldsymbol{\kappa}})</script><p>K is the kernel matrix.The kernel function is:<br>$k(x,x^{\prime})\doteq\sigma_p^2\cdot\phi(x)^\top\phi(x^{\prime})$<br>The kernel matrix is a covariance matrix and the kernel function measures the covariance of the function values $k(x,x^{\prime})=\mathrm{Cov}\big[f(x),f(x^{\prime})\big].$<br>Moreover, note that we have reformulated the learning algorithm such that the feature space is now implicit in the choice of kernel, and the kernel is defined by inner products of (nonlinearly transformed) inputs. In other words, the choice of kernel implicitly determines the class of functions that f is sampled from, and encodes our prior beliefs. This is known as the kernel trick.</p>

You write posts in Markdown (or other markup languages) and Hexo generates static files with a beautiful theme in seconds.”</p>
<h2><span id="how-to-use-hexo">how to use hexo</span></h2><p>Hexo is dependent on Git and Node.js. After installed the two, if you are lucky, you can start to use Hexo as the official documentation(<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hexo.io/docs/">https://hexo.io/docs/</a>) does. Here I will focus on the problems I have met. I accidently uninstalled Node.js and installed newest Node.js on my laptop, however, this action caused a series of problems. I spent 3 hours to fix the problem. In this opportunity, I will document the encountered issues and their solutions. At the same time, I will clarify the dependencies among these software tools.</p>
<h3><span id="problems">problems</span></h3><p>Here we assume that we have installed Git and Node.js successfully. We can check this by running<br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git --version</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">node -v</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The first issue I encountered was when I ran<br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">hexo deploy</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>I got “TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The “mode” argument must be integer”.</p>
<p>As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues/4281">https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues/4281</a> suggests, I upgraded Hexo, but it didn’t work, and there was another problem, I ran<br><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install -g hexo-cli</span><br><span class="line">npm install -g hexo</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>Hexo is still older version. After I modified package.json under the Hexo path and using command like this, it upgraded.<br><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm i hexo@5.2.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Unfortunately, even I upgraded Hexo to the newest version, I still got the error, so I decided to degraded Node.js. This is where I knew about nvm, a command-line tool that allows you to easily manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single machine. With nvm, you can install, switch between, and manage different Node.js versions for your development projects. Remember to uninstall the Node.js first, I didn’t, so when I use nvm to install an older version, I still got the installed version.<br>Finally got the older version, I got “YAMLException: Specified list of YAML types (or a single Type object) contains a non-Type object.”, then as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues/4917">https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues/4917</a> suggests, I degraded Node.js and installed yaml-js.</p>
<p>Running hexo again, I got “TypeError: Cannot read property ‘length’ of undefined” and “Error [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: Package subpath ‘./lib/js-yaml/type’ is not defined by “exports””, then I upgraded the theme I use and ran <code>npm install</code> to fix the problem, but there are still some problems with the theme. I reinstalled the theme as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus">https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus</a>. As the theme upgrading, there are more dependencies needed, just install them as the message shows. </p>
