These tokens can be words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements depending on the specific requirements of the application. </p>
<h2><span id="how-tokenizer-works">how tokenizer works</span></h2><p>There are different types of tokenizer methods.Whitespace Tokenizers, Punctuation-Based Tokenizers,  Word Tokenizers,Sentence Tokenizers,Character Tokenizers, N-gram Tokenizers, Regular Expression Tokenizers and<br>Subword Tokenizers.</p>
<h3><span id="word-tokenizers">Word Tokenizers</span></h3><p>Word tokenization, also known as lexical analysis, is the process of splitting a piece of text into individual words or tokens. Word tokenization typically involves breaking the text into words based on spaces and punctuation. </p>
<h3><span id="subword-tokenizers">Subword Tokenizers</span></h3><p>Subword tokenization algorithms rely on the principle that frequently used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful subwords. A subword tokenizer is a type of tokenizer used in natural language processing (NLP) that breaks down words into smaller units or subwords. This approach is particularly useful for handling rare or out-of-vocabulary words, reducing the vocabulary size, and improving the efficiency of language models.</p>
<h4><span id="common-subword-tokenization-methods">Common Subword Tokenization Methods</span></h4><h5><span id="byte-pair-encoding-bpe">Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)</span></h5><p>BPE is an iterative algorithm that merges the most frequent pairs of characters or subwords in a corpus until a desired vocabulary size is reached.</p>
<h5><span id="wordpiece-tokenization">WordPiece Tokenization</span></h5><p>Similar to BPE, WordPiece builds a vocabulary of subwords based on frequency, optimizing for a balance between vocabulary size and the ability to handle rare words.</p>
<h5><span id="sentencepiece">SentencePiece</span></h5><p>SentencePiece is an unsupervised text tokenizer and detokenizer mainly designed for Neural Network-based text generation systems. It treats the input text as a sequence of Unicode characters and uses a subword model to create subwords.</p>

<h2><span id="markov-chain-monte-carlo-methods">Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods</span></h2><p>The key idea of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is to construct a Markov chain, which is efficient to simulate and has the stationary distribution p.</p>
<h3><span id="markov-chainsstationarityconvergence-markov-propertytime-homogeneous-markov-chains">Markov Chains(Stationarity,convergence), Markov property,time-homogeneous Markov chains</span></h3><p>Intuitively, the Markov property states that future behavior is independent of past states given the present state.</p>
<h3><span id="stationary-distributionaperiodicergodicityfundamental-theorem-of-ergodic-markov-chains">Stationary distribution,aperiodic,Ergodicity,Fundamental theorem of ergodic Markov chains</span></h3><p>After entering a stationary distribution π, a Markov chain will always remain in the stationary distribution.</p>
<p>It can be shown that there exists a unique stationary distribution π if the Markov chain is irreducible, that is, if every state is reachable from every other state with a positive probability when the Markov chain is run for enough steps.</p>
<p>Even if a Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution, it must not converge to it.</p>
<p>In words, a Markov chain is aperiodic iff for every state x, the transition graph has a closed path from x to x with length k for all k ∈ N greater than some k0 ∈ N.</p>
<p>A Markov chain is ergodic iff there exists a t ∈ N0 such that for any x, x′ ∈ S we have p(t)(x′ | x) &gt; 0.</p>
<p>A commonly used strategy to ensure that a Markov chain is ergodic is to add “self-loops” to every vertex in the transition graph.</p>
<p>An ergodic Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution π (with full support) irrespectively of the initial distribution q0. This naturally suggests constructing an ergodic Markov chain such that its stationary distribution coincides with the posterior distribution. If we then sample “sufficiently long”, Xt is drawn from a distribution that is “very close” to the posterior distribution.</p>

<p>Langevin dynamics adapts the Gaussian proposals of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to search the state space in an “informed” direction. The simple idea is to bias the sampling towards states with lower energy, thereby making it more likely that a proposal is accepted.

The resulting variant of Metropolis-Hastings is known as the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) or Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC).</p>

<h3><span id="path">path</span></h3><p>target: show that the stationary distribution of a Markov chain coincides with the posterior distribution.<br>base: Detailed Balance Equation which shows that A Markov chain that satisfies the detailed balance equation with respect to π is called reversible with respect to π and if the Markov chain is reversible with respect to π then π is a stationary distribution. With posterior distribution p(x) = 1/Z q(x), substitute the posterior for π in the detailed balance equation, we can remove z, so we do not need to know the true posterior p to check that the stationary distribution of our Markov chain coincides with p, it suffices to know the finite measure q. However, until now, this does not allow us to estimate expectations over the posterior distribution. Note that although constructing such a Markov chain allows us to obtain samples from the posterior distribution, they are not independent. Thus, the law of large numbers and Hoeffding’s inequality do not apply, but there is a way to generalize the (strong) law of large numbers to Markov chains, which is Ergodic theorem. </p>
<p>Next we need to consider how to construct Markov chain with the goal of approximating samples from the posterior distribution p. One way is Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, in which we are given a proposal distribution and we use the acceptance distribution to decide whether to follow the proposal. Another way is Gibbs sampling. </p>

<h4><span id="slicing-and-dicingpivoting">slicing and dicing,Pivoting</span></h4><p>Slicing involves selecting a specific “slice” or subset of the data cube by fixing one or more dimensions at a particular value. Dicing involves creating a subcube by selecting specific values for two or more dimensions. It’s like slicing, but you are selecting a rectangular subset of the cube, cutting through more than one dimension. Pivoting is another operation often used alongside slicing and dicing. It involves rotating the data cube to view it from a different perspective by swapping the positions of dimensions. </p>
<h4><span id="aggregation-and-roll-up">Aggregation and roll-up</span></h4><p>These operations allow users to summarize and view data at different levels of granularity within a multidimensional dataset. Roll-up is a specific form of aggregation that involves moving from a lower level of detail to a higher level by collapsing one or more dimensions(moving up the hierarchy from a finer level of granularity (monthly) to a coarser level (quarterly)).</p>
<h4><span id="two-flavors-of-olap-rolap-and-molap">Two flavors of OLAP: ROLAP and MOLAP</span></h4><p>ROLAP (Relational Online Analytical Processing) and MOLAP (Multidimensional Online Analytical Processing) are two different approaches to organizing and processing data in the context of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems. In summary, the main difference between ROLAP and MOLAP lies in how they store and organize data. ROLAP uses relational databases to store multidimensional data in tables, while MOLAP uses specialized databases with a cube structure optimized for efficient multidimensional analysis.</p>
<h4><span id="fact-table-and-satellite-table">fact table and Satellite table</span></h4><p>Fact tables are surrounded by dimension tables in a star schema. They usually have foreign key relationships with dimension tables, linking to various dimensions that provide context to the measures. Satellite tables are used to store additional details about dimension members that are not part of the core structure of the dimension table. Satellite tables typically have a foreign key relationship with the main dimension table, linking to the primary key of the dimension. They can be joined to the main dimension table to enrich the analysis with additional context.</p>
<h4><span id="star-schema-and-snow-flake-schema">star schema and snow-flake schema</span></h4><p> In a star schema, there is a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables. The fact table contains quantitative data (measures), and the dimension tables store descriptive data related to the measures. A snowflake schema is an extension of the star schema, where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables. This normalization leads to a structure resembling a snowflake when visualized, as opposed to the star-like structure of a star schema.</p>

<h4><span id="roll-up-and-drill-down">“Roll-up” and “drill down”</span></h4><p> Roll-up involves summarizing data at a higher level of aggregation or moving from a lower level of detail to a higher level. It’s a way of viewing data at a coarser level in the hierarchy. Drill down is the opposite of roll-up. It involves accessing more detailed information or moving from a higher level of aggregation to a lower, more detailed level.</p>
<h4><span id="grouping-sets-cube-rollup">GROUPING SETS, CUBE, ROLLUP</span></h4><p> GROUPING SETS is a SQL feature that allows you to specify multiple grouping sets within a single query.  The CUBE operation is an extension of GROUP BY that generates all possible combinations of grouped elements. ROLLUP is another extension of GROUP BY that generates subtotals and grand totals for a specified set of columns. It creates a hierarchy of grouping levels, calculating subtotals as it rolls up the hierarchy. Note that the column order in rollup is important.</p>

Instead of traversing indexes to find related nodes, the relationships are stored alongside the nodes, allowing for faster and more efficient traversal.Each node maintains direct pointers or references to its neighboring nodes, making it possible to navigate from one node to another without the need for an explicit index lookup. This design principle is particularly beneficial for scenarios where traversing relationships in a graph is a common and performance-critical operation.</p>

<h3><span id="book">book</span></h3><h4><span id="labeled-property-graph-model-vs-triple-stores">Labeled property graph model vs. triple stores</span></h4><p>labeled property graphs enhance mathematical graphs with extra ingredients: properties, and labels.<br>Labels are some sort of “tags”, in the form of a string, that can be attached to a node or an edge.<br>Each node and each edge can be associated with a map from strings to values, which represents its properties.</p>
<p>Triple stores are a different and simpler model. It views the graph as nodes and edges that all have labels, but without any properties.<br>The graph is then represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a triple with the label of the origin node (called the subject), the label of the edge (called the property), and the label of the destination node (called the object).</p>
<p>Labels can be:URIs,Literals, that is, atomic values,Literals are only allowed as objects. Absent, in which case the node is called a blank node. Blank nodes are only allowed as subjects or objects, but not as properties.</p>
<h4><span id="cypher">cypher</span></h4><p>Other graph databases have other means of querying data. Many, including Neo4j, support the RDF query language SPARQL and the imperative, path-based query language Gremlin.</p>
<p>Cypher enables a user (or an application acting on behalf of a user) to ask the database to find data that matches a specific pattern. Colloquially, we ask the database to “find things like this.” And the way we describe what “things like this” look like is to draw them, using ASCII art.</p>
<p>The MATCH clause is at the heart of most Cypher queries. </p>
<h4><span id="native-graph-processing">native graph processing</span></h4><p>To understand why native graph processing is so much more efficient than graphs based on heavy indexing, consider the following. Depending on the implementation, index lookups could be O(log n) in algorithmic complexity versus O(1) for looking up immediate relationships. To traverse a network of m steps, the cost of the indexed approach, at O(m log n), dwarfs the cost of O(m) for an implementation that uses index-free adjacency.</p>
<p>With index-free adjacency, bidirectional joins are effectively precomputed and stored in the database as relationships</p>
<h4><span id="stores">stores</span></h4><p>Neo4j stores graph data in a number of different store files. Each store file contains the data for a specific part of the graph (e.g., there are separate stores for nodes, relationships, labels, and properties). Like most of the Neo4j store files, the node store is a fixed-size record store, where each record is nine bytes in length. Fixed-size records enable fast lookups for nodes in the store file.</p>
<h4><span id="cyphertraverser-api-and-core-api">CYPHER,Traverser API and Core API</span></h4><p>Neo4j’s Core API is an imperative Java API that exposes the graph primitives of nodes, relationships, properties, and labels to the user. When used for reads, the API is lazily evaluated, meaning that relationships are only traversed as and when the calling code demands the next node. </p>
<p>The Traversal Framework is a declarative Java API. It enables the user to specify a set of constraints that limit the parts of the graph the traversal is allowed to visit.</p>
<p>Cypher can be more tolerant of structural changes—things such as variable-length paths help mitigate variation and change.</p>
<p> however, the Traversal Framework tends to perform marginally less well than a well-written Core API query.</p>
<p> Choosing between the Core API and the Traversal Framework is a matter of deciding whether the higher abstraction/lower coupling of the Traversal Framework is sufficient, or whether the close-to-the-metal/higher coupling of the Core API is in fact necessary for implementing an algorithm correctly and in accordance with our performance requirements.</p>

<h3><span id="book">book</span></h3><h4><span id="mapreduce-model">mapreduce model</span></h4><p>In MapReduce, the input data, intermediate data, and output data are all made of a large collection of key-value pairs (with the keys not necessarily unique, and not necessarily sorted by key).</p>
<h4><span id="mapreduce-architecture">MapReduce architecture</span></h4><p>In the original version of MapReduce, the main node is called JobTracker, and the worker nodes are called TaskTrackers.<br>In fact, the JobTracker typically runs on the same machine as the NameNode (and HMaster) and the TaskTrackers on the same machines as the DataNodes (and RegionServers). This is called “bring the query to the data.”</p>
<p>Note that shuffling can start before the map phase is over, but the reduce phase can only start after the map phase is over.</p>
<h4><span id="combine">combine</span></h4><p>Combining happens during the map phase.<br>In fact, in most of the cases, the combine function will be identical to the reduce function, which is generally possible if the intermediate key-value pairs have the same type as the output key-value pairs, and the reduce function is both associative and commutative.</p>
<h4><span id="mapreduce-programming-api">MapReduce programming API</span></h4><p>In Java, the user needs to define a so-called Mapper class that contains the map function, and a Reducer class that contains the reduce function.<br>A map function takes in particular a key and a value. Note that it outputs key-value pairs via the call of the write method on the context, rather than with a return statement.<br>A reduce function takes in particular a key and a list of values.</p>
<h4><span id="functiontaskslotphase">function,task,slot,phase</span></h4><p>A map function is a mathematical, or programmed, function that takes one input key-value pair and returns zero, one or more intermediate key-value pairs.<br>Then, a map task is an assignment (or “homework”, or “TODO”) that consists in a (sequential) series of calls of the map function on a subset of the input.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a combine task. Calls of the combine function are not planned as a task, but is called ad-hoc during flushing and compaction.</p>
<p>The map tasks are processed thanks to compute and memory resources (CPU and RAM). These resources are called map slots. One map slot corresponds to one CPU core and some allocated memory. Each map slot then processes one map task at a time, sequentially.</p>
<p>The map phase thus consists of several map slots processing map tasks in parallel.</p>
<h4><span id="short-circuitingsplit-and-block">short-circuiting(split and block)</span></h4><p>This is because the DataNode process of HDFS and the TaskTracker process of MapReduce are on the same machine.

It was introduced as an additional layer that specifically handles the management of CPU and memory resources in the cluster.<br>YARN, unsurprisingly, is based on a centralized architecture in which the coordinator node is called the ResourceManager, and the worker nodes are called NodeManagers. NodeManagers furthermore provide slots (equipped with exclusively allocated CPU and memory) known as containers.</p>
<p>YARN provides generic support for allocating resources to any application and is application-agnostic. When the user launches a new application, the ResourceManager assigns one of the container to act as the ApplicationMaster which will take care of running the application.</p>
<p>Version 2 of MapReduce works on top of YARN by leaving the job lifecycle management to an ApplicationMaster.<br>It is important to understand that, unlike the JobTracker, the ResourceManager does not monitor tasks, and will not restart slots upon failure. This job is left to the ApplicationMasters.</p>

<h4><span id="rdd">RDD</span></h4><p>lazy evaluation:Lazy evaluation means that the execution of transformations on RDDs is deferred until an action is triggered. Instead of immediately executing the transformations, Spark keeps track of the sequence of transformations in the form of a logical execution plan. The actual computation is only performed when an action is called.</p>
<p>A narrow dependency (also known as a narrow transformation) occurs when each partition of the parent RDD contributes to at most one partition of the child RDD. In other words, the number of partitions remains the same before and after the transformation, and each partition of the child RDD depends on a one-to-one relationship with partitions of the parent RDD.</p>
<p>A wide dependency (also known as a wide transformation) occurs when each partition of the parent RDD contributes to multiple partitions of the child RDD. This typically involves operations that require data shuffling or redistribution, such as groupByKey or reduceByKey.</p>
<h4><span id="data-frames">Data Frames</span></h4><h3><span id="book">book</span></h3><h4><span id="resilient-distributed-datasetsrdds">Resilient distributed datasets(RDDs)</span></h4><p>Resilient means that they remain in memory or on disk on a “best effort” basis, and can be recomputed if need be. Distributed means that, just like the collections of key-value pairs in MapReduce, they are partitioned and spread over multiple machines.<br>A major difference with MapReduce, though, is that RDDs need not be collections of pairs. Since a key-value pair is a particular example of possible value, RDDs are a generalization of the MapReduce model for input, intermediate input and output.</p>

<h4><span id="lazy-evaluation">Lazy evaluation</span></h4><p>It is only with an action that the entire computation pipeline is put into motion, leading to the computation of all the necessary intermediate RDDs all the way down to the final output corresponding to the action.</p>
<h4><span id="physical-architecture">Physical architecture</span></h4><p>There are two kinds of transformations: narrow-dependency transformations and wide-dependency transformations.</p>
<p>Such a chain of narrow-dependency transformations executed efficiently as a single set of tasks is called a stage, which would correspond to what is called a phase in MapReduce.</p>

<p>Note that Spark automatically infers the schema from discovering the JSON Lines file, which adds a static performance overhead that does not exist for raw RDDs: there is no free lunch.</p>
<p>Unlike the RDD transformation API, there is no guarantee that the execution will happen as written, as the optimizer is free to reorganize the actual computations.</p>
<h4><span id="spark-sql">Spark SQL</span></h4><p>both GROUP BY and ORDER BY will trigger a shuffle in the system.  The SORT BY clause can sort rows within each partition, but not across partitions, i.e., does not induce any shuffling. The DISTRIBUTE BY clause forces a repartition by putting all rows with the same value (for the specified field(s)) into the same new partition.</p>
<p>use both SORT and DISTRIBUTE = the use of another clause, CLUSTER BY.</p>
<p>A word of warning must be given on SORT, DISTRIBUTE and CLUSTER clauses: they are, in fact, a breach of data independence, because they expose partitions.</p>
<p>explode() and lateral view: Lateral views are more powerful and generic than just an explode() because they give more control, and they can also be used to go down several levels of nesting. </p>
<h3><span id="book">book</span></h3><h3><span id="exercise">exercise</span></h3><p>Spark’s RDDs are by default recomputed each time you run an action on them.

<h4><span id="normal-forms">Normal forms</span></h4><p>The first normal form was already covered earlier: it is in fact atomic integrity.<br>The second normal form takes it to the next level: it requires that each column in a record contains information on the entire record.

<h4><span id="sql">SQL</span></h4><p>SQL is a declarative language, which means that the user specifies what they want, and not how to compute it: it is up to the underlying system to figure out how to best execute the query. It is also a set-based language, in the sense that it manipulates sets of records at a time, rather than single values as is common in other languages. It is also, to some limited extent, a functional language in the sense that it contains expressions that can nest in each other (nested queries).</p>
<h4><span id="acid">ACID</span></h4><p>There are four main properties (often called ACID):Atomicity,Consistency,Isolation,Durability.</p>

<h2><span id="document-stores">document stores</span></h2><h3><span id="book">book</span></h3><p>Document stores provide a native database management system for semi-structured data. A document store typically specializes in either JSON or XML data, even though some companies (e.g., MarkLogic) offer support for both. It is important to understand that document stores are optimized for the typical use cases of many records of small to medium sizes. Typically, a collection can have millions or billions of documents, while each single document weighs no more than 16 MB (or a size in a similar magnitude).</p>
<h4><span id="mongodb">MongoDB</span></h4><p>In MongoDB, the format is a binary version of JSON called BSON.</p>
<p>The API of MongoDB, like many document stores, is based on the CRUD paradigm. CRUD means Create, Read, Update, Delete.</p>
<p>MongoDB automatically adds to every inserted document a special field called “ id” and associated with a value called an Object ID and with a type of its own.</p>
<h4><span id="hash-indices-and-tree-indices">hash indices and tree indices</span></h4><p>Hash indices are used to optimize point queries and more generally query that select on a specific value of a field.</p>
<h4><span id="secondary-indices">Secondary indices</span></h4><p>By default, MongoDB always builds a tree index for the id field. Users can request to build hash and tree indices for more fields. These indices are called secondary indices.</p>
<h3><span id="exercise">exercise</span></h3><p>By default, MongoDB creates the _id index, which is an ascending unique index on the _id field, for all collections when the collection is created. You cannot remove the index on the _id field.</p>
<h2><span id="querying-denormalized-data">Querying denormalized data</span></h2><h3><span id="book">book</span></h3><h4><span id="features-of-a-query-language">Features of a query language</span></h4><p>First, it is declarative. This means that the users do not focus on how the query is computed, but on what it should return.</p>
<p>Second, it is functional. This means that the query language is made of composable expressions that nest with each other, like a Lego game.</p>
<p>Finally, it is set-based, in the sense that the values taken and returned by expressions are not only single values (scalars), but are large sequences of items (in the case of SQL, an item is a row).</p>
<h4><span id="jsoniq">JSONiq</span></h4><p>It is possible to filter any sequence with a predicate, where <script type="math/tex">in the predicate refers to the current item being tested.
example: "json-doc("file.json").o[].a.b[][</script>.c = 3]”<br>To access the n-th member of an array, you can use double-squarebrackets: “json-doc(“file.json”).o[[2]].a”.</p>
<p>Do not confuse sequence positions (single square brackets) with array positions (double square brackets)!</p>
<p>The empty sequence enjoys special treatment: if one of the sides (or both) is the empty sequence, then the arithmetic expression returns an empty sequence (no error).</p>
<p>Note that unlike SQL, JSONiq logic expressions are two-valued and return either true or false.</p>
<h4><span id="general-comparison">general comparison</span></h4><p>universal and existential quantification: every and some;<br>JSONiq has a shortcut for existential quantification on value comparisons. This is called general comparison.</p>
<h4><span id="flwor-expressions">FLWOR expressions</span></h4><p>One of the most important and powerful features of JSONiq is the FLWOR expression. It corresponds to SELECT-FROM-WHERE queries in SQL.</p>
<h3><span id="exercise">exercise</span></h3><p>Accessing a JSON dataset can be done in two ways depending on the exact format:<br>If this is a file that contains a single JSON object spread over multiple lines, use json-doc(URL).<br>If this is a file that contains one JSON object per line (JSON Lines), use json-file(URL).</p>
<h2><span id="hdfs">HDFS</span></h2><h3><span id="book">book</span></h3><h4><span id="hdfs-data-model">HDFS data model</span></h4><p>HDFS does not follow a key-value model: instead, an HDFS cluster organizes its files as a hierarchy, called the file namespace. Files are thus organized in directories, similar to a local file system.</p>
<h4><span id="key-value-model-vs-file-hierarchy">key-value model vs file hierarchy</span></h4><p>The key-value model and file hierarchy are two different approaches to organizing and accessing data within storage systems. While the key-value model excels in flexibility and quick data access, file hierarchy provides a structured and predictable organization suitable for many traditional storage use cases.</p>
<h4><span id="object-storage-vs-block-storage">object storage vs block storage</span></h4><p>Organizes data as objects, each containing both data and metadata. Objects are stored in a flat address space.<br>Organizes data as fixed-size blocks, typically within storage volumes.Requires a file system to manage and organize data into files and directories.</p>
<h4><span id="object-storage-and-key-value-model">object storage and key-value model</span></h4><p>Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects, each containing both data and metadata. Objects are stored in a flat address space without the hierarchy found in traditional file systems. In the key-value model, data is organized as pairs of keys and values. Each key uniquely identifies a value, and the system allows for the efficient retrieval and storage of data based on these key-value pairs.<br>Object storage systems often use a key-value model internally to manage objects. Each object has a unique identifier (key), and the associated data and metadata form the corresponding value.</p>
<h4><span id="physical-architecture">physical architecture</span></h4><p>In the case of HDFS, the central node is called the NameNode and the other nodes are called the DataNodes. In fact, more precisely, the NameNode and DataNodes are processes running on these nodes.<br>The NameNode stores in particular three things:the file namespace,a mapping from each file to the list of its blocks, a mapping from each block, represented with its 64-bit identifier, to the locations of its replicas.</p>

Also, a leading 0 is not allowed except if the integer part is exactly 0 (in which case it is even mandatory).<br>Objects are simply maps from strings to values. The keys of an object must be strings.<br>The JSON standard recommends for keys to be unique within an object.</p>
<h4><span id="unicode">unicode</span></h4><p>Unicode is a standard that assigns a numeric code (called a code point) to each character in order to catalogue them across all languages of the world, even including emojis. The code point must be indicated in base 16. </p>
<h4><span id="xml">XML</span></h4><p>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.<br>XML’s most important building blocks are elements, attributes, text and comments.<br>Unlike JSON keys, element names can repeat at will.<br>At the top-level, a well-formed XML document must have exactly one element.<br>Attributes appear in any opening elements tag and are basically keyvalue pairs. Values can be either double-quoted or single-quoted. The key is never quoted, and it is not allowed to have unquoted values. Within the same opening tag, there cannot be duplicate keys. Attributes can never appear in a closing tag. It is not allowed to create attributes that start with XML or xml, or any case combination. because this is reserved for namespace declarations.<br>a single comment alone is not well-formed XML (remember: we need exactly one top-level element).<br>XML documents can be identified as such with an optional text declaration containing a version number and an encoding.<br>Another tag that might appear right below, or instead of, the text declaration is the doctype declaration. It must then repeat the name of the top-level element.<br>Remember that in JSON, it is possible to escape sequences with a backslash character. In XML, this is done with an ampersand (&amp;) character.<br>Escape sequences can be used anywhere in text, and in attribute values.there are a few places where they are mandatory: In text, &amp; and &lt; MUST be escaped. In double-quoted attribute values, ”, &amp; and &lt; MUST be escaped. In single-quoted attribute values, ’, &amp; and &lt; MUST be escaped. </p>
<h4><span id="namespaces-in-xml">Namespaces in XML</span></h4><p>A namespace is identified with a URI.<br>The triplet (namespace, prefix, localname) is called a QName (for “qualified name”).<br>For the purpose of the comparisons of two QNames (and thus of documents), the prefix is ignored: only the local name and the namespace are compared.<br>First, unprefixed attributes are not sensitive to default namespaces: unlike elements, the namespace of an unprefixed attribute is always absent even if there is a default namespace. </p>
<h3><span id="exercise">exercise</span></h3><h4><span id="xml-names">xml names</span></h4><p>Remember:<br>Element names are case-sensitive.<br>Element names must start with a letter or underscore.<br>Element names cannot start with the letters xml (or XML, or Xml, etc).<br>Element names can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods.<br>Element names cannot contain spaces.</p>
<h4><span id="json-key-names">JSON Key names</span></h4><p> The only restriction the JSON syntax imposes on the key names is that “ and \ must be escaped.</p>
<h2><span id="wide-column-stores">Wide column stores</span></h2><h3><span id="book">book</span></h3><h4><span id="hdfs-vs-wide-column-stores">HDFS VS Wide column stores</span></h4><p>The problem with HDFS is its latency: HDFS works well with very large files (at least hundreds of MBs so that blocks even start becoming useful), but will have performance issues if accessing millions of small XML or JSON files. Wide column stores were invented to provide more control over performance and in particular, in order to achieve high-throughput and low latency for objects ranging from a few bytes to about 10 MB, which are too big and numerous to be efficiently stored as so-called clobs (character large objects) or blobs (binary large objects) in a relational database system, but also too small and numerous to be efficiently accessed in a distributed file system. </p>
<h4><span id="object-storage-vs-wide-column-stores">object storage VS Wide column stores</span></h4><p>a wide column store has additional benefits: a wide column store will be more tightly integrated with the parallel data processing systems.wide column stores have a richer logical model than the simple key-value model behind object storage; wide column stores also handle very small values (bytes and kBs) well thanks to batch processing.</p>
<h4><span id="hbase">HBase</span></h4><p>From an abstract perspective, HBase can be seen as an enhanced keyvalue store, in the sense that:a key is compound and involves a row, a column and a version; keys are sortable; values can be larger (clobs, blobs), up to around 10 MB. On the logical level, the data is organized in a tabular fashion: as a collection of rows. Each row is identified with a row ID. Row IDs can be compared, and the rows are logically sorted by row ID.  Column qualifiers are arrays of bytes (rather than strings), and as for row IDs, there is a library to easily create column qualifiers from primitive values. </p>
<p>HBase supports four kinds of low-level queries: get, put, scan and delete. Unlike a traditional key-value store, HBase also supports querying ranges of row IDs and ranges of timestamps.</p>
<p>HBase offers a locking mechanism at the row level, meaning that different rows can be modified concurrently, but the cells in the same row cannot: only one user at a time can modify any given row.</p>
<p>A table in HBase is physically partitioned in two ways: on the rows and on the columns. The rows are split in consecutive regions. Each region is identified by a lower and an upper row key, the lower row key being included and the upper row key excluded. A partition is called a store and corresponds to the intersection of a region and of a column family. </p>
<p>All the cells within a store are eventually persisted on HDFS, in files that we will call HFiles. An HFile is, in fact, nothing else than a (boring) flat list of KeyValues, one per cell. What is important is that, in an HFile, all these KeyValues are sorted by key in increasing order.</p>
<h4><span id="hdfs-block-and-hblock">HDFS block and HBlock</span></h4><p>HBase uses index structures to quickly skip to the position of the HBase block which may hold the requested key. Note HBase block is not to be confused with HDFS block and the underlying file system block.By default, each HBase block is 64KB (configurable) in size and always contains whole key-value pairs, so, if a block needs more than 64KB to avoid splitting a key-value pair, it will just grow.</p>
<h4><span id="log-structured-merge-trees">Log-structured merge trees</span></h4><p>Upon flushing, all cells are written sequentially to a new HFile in ascending key order, HBlock by HBlock, concurrently building the index structure. In fact, sorting is not done in the last minute when flushing. Rather, what happens is that when cells are added to memory, they are added inside a data structure that maintains them in sorted order (such as tree maps) and then flushing is a linear traversal of the tree.</p>
<h4><span id="bloom-filters">Bloom filters</span></h4><p>HBase has a mechanism to avoid looking for cells in every HFile. This mechanism is called a Bloom filter. It is basically a black box that can tell with absolute certainty that a certain key does not belong to an HFile, while it only predicts with good probability (albeit not certain) that it does belong to it.</p>
<h3><span id="exercise">exercise</span></h3><h4><span id="bloom-filters">Bloom filters</span></h4><p>Bloom filters are a data structure used to speed up queries, useful in the case in which it’s likely that the value we are looking doesn’t exist in the collection we are querying. Their main component is a bit array with all values initially set to 0. When a new element is inserted in the collection, its value is first run through a certain number of (fixed) hash functions, and the locations in the bit array corresponding to the outputs of these functions are set to 1.</p>
<p>This means that when we query for a certain value, if the value has previously been inserted in the collection then all the locations corresponding to the hash function outputs will certainly already have been set to 1. On the contrary, if the element hasn’t been previously inserted, then the locations may or may not have already been set to 1 by other elements. Then, if prior to accessing the collection we run our queried value through the hash functions, check the locations corresponding to the outputs, and find any of them to be 0, we are guaranteed that the element is not present in the collection (No False Negatives), and we don’t have to waste time looking. If the corresponding locations are all set to 1, the element may or may not be present in the collection (possibility of False Positives), but in the worst case we’re just wasting time. </p>
<p>As you have seen in the task above, HBase has to check all HFiles, along with the MemStore, when looking for a particular key. As an optimisation, Bloom filters are used to avoid checking an HFile if possible. Before looking inside a particular HFile, HBase first checks the requested key against the Bloom filter associated with that HFile. If it says that the key does not exist, the file is not read.</p>
<p>a Bloom filter can produce false positive outcomes. Luckily, it never produces false negative outcomes.</p>
<h4><span id="log-structured-merge-tree-lsm-tree-optional">Log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree) (optional)</span></h4><p>As opposed to B+-tree which has a time complexity of O(log n) when inserting new elements, n being the total number of elements in the tree, LSM tree has O(1) for inserting, which is a constant cost. </p>

<h4><span id="the-xml-information-set">The XML Information Set</span></h4><p>A fundamental difference between JSON trees and XML trees is that for JSON, the labels (object keys) are on the edges connecting an object information item to each one of its children information items. In XML, the labels (these would be element and attribute names) are on the nodes (information items) directly.</p>
<h4><span id="item-types">Item types</span></h4><p>Also, all atomic types have in common that they have a logical value space and a lexical value space. Atomic types can be in a subtype relationship: a type is a subtype of another type if its logical value space is a subset of the latter.<br>However, in modern databases, it is customary to support unbounded integers.<br>Decimals correspond to real numbers that can be written as a finite sequence of digits in base 10, with an optional decimal period.Support for the entire decimal value space can be costly in performance. In order to address this issue, a floating-point standard (IEEE 754) was invented and is still very popular today.<br>Timestamp values are typically stored as longs (64-bit integers) expressing the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 by convention.<br>XML Schema, JSound and JSONiq follow the ISO 8601 standard.<br>The lexical representation of duration can vary, but there is a standard defined by ISO 8601 as well, starting with a P and prefixing sub-day parts with a T.<br>Maps (not be confused with records, which are similar) are maps from any atomic value to any value, i.e., generalize objects to keys that are not necessarily strings (e.g., numbers, dates, etc). However, unlike records, the type of the values must be the same for all keys.<br><img src="/2024/01/03/bigdata13/image-123.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h4><span id="jsound-and-json-schema">JSound and JSON Schema</span></h4><p>JSound is a schema language that was designed to be simple for 80% of the cases, making it particularly suitable in a teaching environment. It is independent of any programming language.<br>JSON Schema is another technology for validating JSON documents.<br>The type system of JSON Schema is thus less rich than that of JSound, but extra checks can be done with so-called formats, which include date, time, duration, email, and so on including generic regular expressions.<br>It is possible to require the presence of a key by adding an exclamation mark in JSound. in JSON Schema, which uses a “required” property associated with the list of required keys to express the same.<br>In the JSound compact syntax, extra keys are forbidden. Unlike JSound, in JSON Schema, extra properties are allowed by default. JSON Schema then allows to forbid extra properties with the “additionalProperties” property.<br>There are a few more features available in the compact JSound syntax (not in JSON Schema) with the special characters @, ? and =. The question mark (?) allows for null values (which are not the same as absent values). The arobase (@) indicates that one or more fields are primary keys for a list of objects that are members of the same array. The equal sign (=) is used to indicate a default value that is automatically populated if the value is absent.<br><img src="/2024/01/03/bigdata13/image-124.png" alt="Alt text"><br>Note that some values are quoted, which does not matter for validation: validation only checks whether lexical values are part of the type’s lexical space.</p>
<p>Accepting any values in JSound can be done with the type “item”, which contains all possible values. In JSON Schema, in order to declare a field to accept any values, you can use either true or an empty object in lieu of the type.</p>
<p>JSON Schema additionally allows to use false to forbid a field.</p>
<p>In JSON Schema, it is also possible to combine validation checks with Boolean combinations using “anyOf”.JSound schema allows defining unions of types with the vertical bar inside type strings. </p>
<p>In JSON Schema only (not in JSound), it is also possible to do a conjunction (logical and) with “allOf” as well as exclusive with “oneOf” as well as negation with “not”.</p>
<h4><span id="xml-schema">XML Schema</span></h4><p>all elements in an XML Schema are in a namespace, the XML Schema namespace. The namespace is prescribed by the XML Schema standard and must be this one. </p>
<h4><span id="dataframe">dataframe</span></h4><p>There is a particular subclass of semi-structured datasets that are very interesting: valid datasets, which are collections of JSON objects valid against a common schema, with some requirements on the considered schemas. The datasets belonging to this particular subclass are called data frames, or dataframes.<br>relational tables are data frames, while data frames are not necessarily relational tables: data frames can be (and are often) nested, but they are still relatively homogeneous to some extent.Thus, Data frames are a generalization of (normalized) relational tables allowing for (organized and structured) nestedness.</p>
<h4><span id="data-format">data format</span></h4><p>In fact, if the data is structured as a (valid) data frame, then there are many, many different formats that it can be stored in, and in a way that is much more efficient than JSON. These formats are highly optimized and typically stored in binary form, for example Parquet, Avro, Root, Google’s protocol buffers, etc.</p>
<p>Why is it possible to store the data more efficiently when it is valid and data-frame-friendly? One important reason is that the schema can be stored as a header in the binary format, and the data can be stored without repeating the fields in every record (as is done in textual JSON).</p>

<h3><span id="preference-list-and-coordinator">preference list and coordinator</span></h3><p>A node handling a read or write operation is known as the coordinator. Typically, this is the first among the top N nodes in the preference list.</p>
<h3><span id="quorum-like-system">quorum-like system</span></h3><p>To maintain consistency among its replicas, Dynamo uses a consistency protocol similar to those used in quorum systems. This protocol has two key configurable values: R and W. R is the minimum number of nodes that must participate in a successful read operation. W is the minimum number of nodes that must participate in a successful write operation. Setting R and W such that R + W &gt; N yields a quorum-like system.</p>
<p>To remedy this it does not enforce strict quorum membership and instead it uses a “sloppy quorum”; all read and write operations are performed on the first N healthy nodes from the preference list.</p>
<h3><span id="merkle-trees">Merkle Trees</span></h3><p>A hash tree or Merkle tree is a binary tree in which every leaf node gets as its label a data block and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Some KeyValue stores use Merkle trees for efficiently detecting inconsistencies in data between replicas.</p>

Lastly, and importantly, Dremel uses a column-striped storage representation, which enables it to read less data from secondary storage and reduce CPU cost due to cheaper compression.</p>
<h3><span id="repetition-and-definition-levels">Repetition and definition levels</span></h3><p>we define the repetition level as the number of repeated fields in the common prefix (including the first path element identifying the record). The definition level specifies the number of optional and repeated fields in the path (excluding the first path element).A definition level smaller than the maximal number of repeated and optional fields in a path denotes a NULL.</p>
<h2><span id="hdfs">HDFS</span></h2><p>Each block replica on a DataNode is represented by two files in the local host’s native file system. The first file contains the data itself and the second file is block’s metadata including checksums for the block data and the block’s generation stamp.</p>
<p>If the NameNode does not receive a heartbeat from a DataNode in ten minutes the NameNode considers the DataNode to be out of service and the block replicas hosted by that DataNode to be unavailable. The NameNode then schedules creation of new replicas of those blocks on other DataNodes. Heartbeats from a DataNode also carry information about total storage capacity, fraction of storage in use, and the number of data transfers currently in progress. These statistics are used for the NameNode’s space allocation and load balancing decisions. The NameNode does not directly call DataNodes. It uses replies to heartbeats to send instructions to the DataNodes.</p>
<p>A recently introduced feature of HDFS is the BackupNode. Like a CheckpointNode, the BackupNode is capable of creating periodic checkpoints, but in addition it maintains an inmemory, up-to-date image of the file system namespace that is always synchronized with the state of the NameNode.</p>
<p>A replica stored on a DataNode may become corrupted because of faults in memory, disk, or network. HDFS generates and stores checksums for each data block of an HDFS file. Checksums are verified by the HDFS client while reading to help detect any corruption caused either by client, DataNodes, or network. When a client creates an HDFS file, it computes the checksum sequence for each block and sends it to a DataNode along with the data. A DataNode stores checksums in a metadata file separate from the block’s data file. When HDFS reads a file, each block’s data and checksums are shipped to the client. The client computes the checksum for the received data and verifies that the newly computed checksums matches the checksums it received. If not, the client notifies the NameNode of the corrupt replica and then fetches a different replica of the block from another DataNode.</p>
<p>The design of HDFS I/O is particularly optimized for batch processing systems, like MapReduce, which require high throughput for sequential reads and writes.</p>
<p>Currently HDFS provides a configurable block placement policy interface so that the users and researchers can experiment and test any policy that’s optimal for their applications.</p>
<p>When a block becomes over replicated, the NameNode chooses a replica to remove. The NameNode will prefer not to reduce the number of racks that host replicas, and secondly prefer to remove a replica from the DataNode with the least amount of available disk space. When a block becomes under-replicated, it is put in the replication priority queue.  A background thread periodically scans the head of the replication queue to decide where to place new replicas.</p>
<p>HDFS block placement strategy does not take into account DataNode disk space utilization. This is to avoid placing new—more likely to be referenced—data at a small subset of the DataNodes. </p>
<p>Each DataNode runs a block scanner that periodically scans its block replicas and verifies that stored checksums match the block data.  Whenever a read client or a block scanner detects a corrupt block, it notifies the NameNode. The NameNode marks the replica as corrupt, but does not schedule deletion of the replica immediately. Instead, it starts to replicate a good copy of the block. Only when the good replica count reaches the replication factor of the block the corrupt replica is scheduled to be removed. So even if all replicas of a block are corrupt, the policy allows the user to retrieve its data from the corrupt replicas.</p>
<p>A present member of the cluster that becomes excluded is marked for decommissioning. Once a DataNode is marked as decommissioning, it will not be selected as the target of replica placement, but it will continue to serve read requests. The NameNode starts to schedule replication of its blocks to other DataNodes. Once the NameNode detects that all blocks on the decommissioning DataNode are replicated, the node enters the decommissioned state. Then it can be safely removed from the cluster without jeopardizing any data availability.</p>

<h2><span id="olap-and-data-warehouses">OLAP and Data Warehouses</span></h2><p>Data from many separate databases may be integrated into the warehouse. The warehouse is usually only updated overnight. Data warehouses play an important role in OLAP applications. First, the warehouse is necessary to organize and centralize data in a way that supports OLAP queries. Second, OLAP queries are usually complex and touching much of the data and take too much time to be executed in a transaction-processing system with high throughput requirements.</p>
<h2><span id="a-multidimensional-view-of-olap-data">A Multidimensional View of OLAP Data</span></h2><p>In typical OLAP applications there is a central relation or collection of data called the fact table. Often, it helps to think of the objects in the fact table as arranged in a multidimensional space. Two broad directions that have been taken by specialized systems that support cube-structured data for OLAP: ROLAP and MOLAP. ROLAP, which is Relational OLAP. In this approach, data may be stored in relations with a specialized structure called a “star schema”. MOLAP, which is Multidimensional OLAP. A specialized structure “data cude” is used to hold the data, including its aggregates.</p>
<h2><span id="star-schemas">Star Schemas</span></h2><p>A star schema consists of the schema for the fact table, which links to several other relations, called “dimension tables”. </p>
<h2><span id="slicing-and-dicing">Slicing and Dicing</span></h2><p>A choice of partition for each dimension “dices” the cude. The result is that the cude is divided into smaller cubes that represent groups of points whose statistics are aggregated by a query that performs this partitioning in its “group by” clause. Through the “where” clause, a query has the option of focusing on particular partitions alone one or more dimensions.(on a particular “slice” of the cube).<br><img src="/2023/12/12/bigdata12/image-82.png" alt="Alt text"></p>

<p>Now, why is it efficient? Because doing down a tree only necessitates following pointers in memory. But trees cannot have cycles. Graph databases provide a way of generalizing the use in-memory pointers to traverse data to the general case in which cycles are present: this is called “index-free adjacency.”</p>
<h2><span id="kinds-of-graph-databases">Kinds of graph databases</span></h2><p>There are many different graph database system products on the market, and they can be classified along several dimensions: Labeled property graph model vs. triple stores;Read-intensive vs. write-intensive;Local vs. distributed;Native vs. non-native. </p>
<h2><span id="graph-data-models">Graph data models</span></h2><h3><span id="labeled-property-graphs">Labeled property graphs</span></h3><p>Computer scientists need to go one step further and also design how to store graphs physically. One way of doing so is to create an associative array mapping each node to the list of nodes that it connects to via an edge (adjacency lists). Another storage form is with an adjacency matrix: each row and each column represent a node, and a 0 or a 1 indicate the absence or presence of an edge between the row node and the column node. </p>
<p>Now, this does not quite work for us, because labeled property graphs enhance mathematical graphs with extra ingredients: properties, and labels.<br>how to “convert” a relational table to a labeled property graph: labels can be seen as table names, nodes as records, and properties as the attribute values for the records. This shows that relational tables can be physically stored as labeled property graphs. Of course, this does not work the other way round: given a graph, it will often not be possible to convert it “back” to a table in this specific way.</p>
<h3><span id="triple-stores">Triple stores</span></h3><p>Triple stores are a different and simpler model. It views the graph as nodes and edges that all have labels, but without any properties. The graph is then represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a triple with the label of the origin node (called the subject), the label of the edge (called the property), and the label of the destination node (called the object).</p>
<p>Triple stores typically provide SPARQL capabilities to reason about and stored RDF data.</p>
<h2><span id="querying-graph-data">Querying graph data</span></h2><p>We will now have a look at query languages for querying graphs, with a focus on Cypher, which is neo4j’s query language.<br><img src="/2023/12/12/bigdata11/image-89.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h3><span id="cypher-philosophy">Cypher Philosophy</span></h3><p>Cypher enables a user (or an application acting on behalf of a user) to ask the database to find data that matches a specific pattern. Colloquially, we ask the database to “find things like this.” And the way we describe what “things like this” look like is to draw them, using ASCII art.</p>
<p>Like most query languages, Cypher is composed of clauses. The simplest queries consist of a MATCH clause followed by a RETURN clause. There are other clauses we can use in a Cypher query: WHERE,WITH…AS…,CREATE,MERGE,DELETE,SET,UNION,FORWACH and so on. </p>
<h3><span id="a-comparison-of-relational-and-graph-modeling">A Comparison of Relational and Graph Modeling</span></h3><p>Relational databases—with their rigid schemas and complex modeling characteristics—are not an especially good tool for supporting rapid change. What we need is a model that is closely aligned with the domain, but that doesn’t sacrifice performance, and that supports evolution while maintaining the integrity of the data as it undergoes rapid change and growth. That model is the graph model.</p>
<h3><span id="creating-a-graph">creating a graph</span></h3><p>In practice, we tend to use CREATE when we’re adding to the graph and don’t mind duplication, and MERGE when duplication is not permitted by the domain.</p>
<h3><span id="beginning-a-query">Beginning a Query</span></h3><p>In Cypher we always begin our queries from one or more well-known starting points in the graph—what are called bound nodes. Cypher uses any labels and property predicates supplied in the MATCH and WHERE clauses, together with metadata supplied by indexes and constraints, to find the starting points that anchor our graph patterns.</p>
<h3><span id="indexes-and-constraints">INDEXES AND CONSTRAINTS</span></h3><p>To support efficient node lookup, Cypher allows us to create indexes per label and property combinations. For unique property values we can also specify constraints that assure uniqueness.</p>
<h1><span id="neo4j">Neo4j</span></h1><p> Neo4j is a graph database with native processing capabilities as well as native graph storage.</p>
<h2><span id="native-graph-processing">Native Graph Processing</span></h2><p>Of the many different engine architectures, we say that a graph database has native processing capabilities if it exhibits a property called index-free adjacency.</p>
<p>A database engine that utilizes index-free adjacency is one in which each node maintains direct references to its adjacent nodes. Each node, therefore, acts as a micro-index of other nearby nodes, which is much cheaper than using global indexes. It means that query times are independent of the total size of the graph, and are instead simply proportional to the amount of the graph searched. A nonnative graph database engine, in contrast, uses (global) indexes to link nodes together.</p>
<p>Proponents for native graph processing argue that index-free adjacency is crucial for fast, efficient graph traversals. To understand why native graph processing is so much more efficient than graphs based on heavy indexing, consider the following. Depending on the implementation, index lookups could be O(log n) in algorithmic complexity versus O(1) for looking up immediate relationships. To traverse a network of m steps, the cost of the indexed approach, at O(m log n), dwarfs the cost of O(m) for an implementation that uses index-free adjacency.</p>
<h2><span id="native-graph-storage">Native Graph Storage</span></h2><p>Neo4j stores graph data in a number of different store files. Each store file contains the data for a specific part of the graph (e.g., there are separate stores for nodes, relationships, labels, and properties).The division of storage responsibilities—particularly the separation of graph structure from property data—facilitates performant graph traversals, even though it means the user’s view of their graph and the actual records on disk are structurally dissimilar.</p>
<p>Like most of the Neo4j store files, the node store is a fixed-size record store, where each record is nine bytes in length. Fixed-size records enable fast lookups for nodes in the store file. If we have a node with id 100, then we know its record begins 900 bytes into the file. Based on this format, the database can directly compute a record’s location, at cost O(1), rather than performing a search, which would be cost O(log n).</p>
<h2><span id="transactions">Transactions</span></h2><p>Transactions in Neo4j are semantically identical to traditional database transactions. Writes occur within a transaction context, with write locks being taken for consistency purposes on any nodes and relationships involved in the transaction. On successful completion of the transaction, changes are flushed to disk for durability, and the write locks released. These actions maintain the atomicity guarantees of the transaction. </p>
<h3><span id="core-api-traversal-framework-or-cypher">CORE API, TRAVERSAL FRAMEWORK, OR CYPHER?</span></h3><p>The Core API allows developers to fine-tune their queries so that they exhibit high affinity with the underlying graph. A well-written Core API query is often faster than any other approach. The downside is that such queries can be verbose, requiring considerable developer effort. Moreover, their high affinity with the underlying graph makes them tightly coupled to its structure. When the graph structure changes, they can often break. Cypher can be more tolerant of structural changes—things such as variable-length paths help mitigate variation and change.</p>
<p>The Traversal Framework is both more loosely coupled than the Core API (because it allows the developer to declare informational goals), and less verbose, and as a result a query written using the Traversal Framework typically requires less developer effort than the equivalent written using the Core API. Because it is a general-purpose framework, however, the Traversal Framework tends to perform marginally less well than a well-written Core API query.</p>

<p>difference between neo4j and RDF:<br>Data Model:<br>Neo4j: Neo4j is a graph database that uses the property graph data model. In this model, nodes represent entities, relationships represent connections between entities, and both nodes and relationships can have key-value pairs as properties.<br>RDF: RDF is a data model for representing knowledge in the form of subject-predicate-object triples. Each triple represents a statement, and these triples can be used to build a graph of linked data. RDF is more abstract and can be implemented using various storage formats.</p>
<p>Query Language:<br>Neo4j: Neo4j uses the Cypher query language, which is specifically designed for querying graph databases. Cypher allows users to express graph patterns and relationships in a concise and readable manner.<br>RDF: RDF data is typically queried using SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). SPARQL is a query language for querying and manipulating RDF data, and it provides powerful capabilities for navigating the graph structure.</p>
<p>Graph Structure:<br>Neo4j: In Neo4j, the graph is explicit, with nodes, relationships, and properties forming a connected graph structure. The focus is on relationships between entities and their properties.<br>RDF: RDF represents a graph, but the graph structure is more implicit. Resources are identified by URIs, and relationships are expressed through triples, allowing for the creation of a distributed and linked data web.</p>
<p>Schema:<br>Neo4j: Neo4j supports a flexible schema where nodes and relationships can have dynamic properties. While it provides some level of schema flexibility, users can define constraints and indexes to enforce certain structures.<br>RDF: RDF is schema-agnostic, allowing for more dynamic and extensible data representation. Schemas can be defined using RDF vocabularies and ontologies, such as RDFS and OWL.</p>
<p>Use Cases:<br>Neo4j: Neo4j is often used for applications where relationships and graph structures are central, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and network analysis.<br>RDF: RDF is commonly used in the context of the Semantic Web for representing and linking diverse data sources, allowing for interoperability and knowledge representation.</p>
