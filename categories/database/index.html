<h2><span id="the-json-information-set">The JSON Information Set</span></h2><p>The appropriate abstraction for any JSON document is a tree. The nodes of that tree, which are JSON logical values, are naturally of six possible kinds: the six syntactic building blocks of JSON.</p>
<p>These are the four leaves corresponding to atomic values:Strings, Numbers,Booleans, Nulls. As well as two intermediate nodes: Objects, Arrays. These nodes are generally called information items and form the logical building blocks of the model, called information set.</p>
<h2><span id="the-xml-information-set">The XML Information Set</span></h2><p>A fundamental difference between JSON trees and XML trees is that for JSON, the labels (object keys) are on the edges connecting an object information item to each one of its children information items. In XML, the labels (these would be element and attribute names) are on the nodes (information items) directly.</p>
<p>In XML, there are many more information items: Document information items, Element, Attribute, Character, Comment, Processing instruction, Name space, Unexpanded entity reference, DTD, Unparsed entity, Notation. Here we only focus on documents, elements, attributes, and characters.</p>
<h2><span id="validation">Validation</span></h2><p>Once documents, JSON or XML, have been parsed and logically abstracted as a tree in memory, the natural next step is to check for further structural constraints.</p>
<p>In a relational database, the schema of a table is defined before any data is populated into the table. Thus, the data in the table is guaranteed, at all times, to fulfil all the constraints of the schema. The schema was enforced at write time (schema on write). A collection of JSON and XML documents out there can exist without any schema and contain arbitrary structures. Validation happens “ex post,” that is, only after reading the data (schema on read).</p>
<p>JSON and XML documents undergo two steps: a well-formedness check: attempt to parse the document and construct a tree representation in memory;(if the first step succeeded) a validation check given a specific schema. Note that, unlike well-formedness, validation is schema dependent: a given well-formed document can be valid against schema A and invalid against schema B.</p>
<h2><span id="item-types">Item types</span></h2><p>A fundamental aspect of validation is the type system. A well-designed type system, in turn, allows for storing the data in much more efficient, binary formats tailored to the model.</p>
<h3><span id="atomic-types">Atomic types</span></h3><p>Atomic types correspond to the leaf of a tree data model: these are types that do not contain any further nestedness. The kinds of atomic types available are also relatively standard and common to most technologies. Also, all atomic types have in common that they have a logical value space and a lexical value space.</p>
<p>An atomic type also has a (not necessarily injective) mapping from its lexical value space to its logical value space (e.g., mapping the hexadecimal literal x10 to the mathematical integer sixteen).<br>Atomic types can be in a subtype relationship: a type is a subtype of another type if its logical value space is a subset of the latter.</p>
<h4><span id="strings">Strings</span></h4><p>In “pure computer science” textbooks, strings are often presented as structured values rather than as atomic values because of their complexity on the physical layer. However, for us data scientists, strings are atomic values.</p>
<h4><span id="numbers-integers">Numbers: integers</span></h4><p>Integers correspond to finite cardinalities (counting) as well as their negative counterparts. In older programming languages, support for integers used to be bounded. However, in modern databases, it is customary to support unbounded integers. Engines can optimize computations for small integers, but might become less efficient with very large integers.</p>
<h4><span id="numbers-decimals">Numbers: decimals</span></h4><p>Decimals correspond to real numbers that can be written as a finite sequence of digits in base 10, with an optional decimal period.</p>
<h4><span id="numbers-floating-point">Numbers: floating-point</span></h4><p>Support for the entire decimal value space can be costly in performance. In order to address this issue, a floating-point standard (IEEE 754) was invented and is still very popular today.</p>
<p>Floating-point numbers are limited both in precision and magnitude (both upper and lower) in order to fit on 32 bits (float) or 64 bits (double). Floats have about 7 digits of precision and their absolute value can be between roughly 10^−37 and 10^37, while doubles have 15 digits of precision and their absolute value can be between roughly 10^−307 and 10^308.</p>
<h4><span id="booleans">Booleans</span></h4><p>The logical value space for the Boolean type is made of two values: true and false as in NoSQL queries, two-valued logic is typically assumed.</p>
<h4><span id="dates-and-times">Dates and times</span></h4><p>Dates are commonly using the Gregorian calendar (with some technologies possibly supporting more) with a year (BC or AD), a month and a day of the month. Times are expressed in the hexagesimal (60) basis with hours, minutes, seconds, where the seconds commonly go all the way to microseconds (six digits after the decimal period). Datetimes are expressed with a year, a month, a day of the month, hours, minutes and (decimal) seconds.</p>
<p>Timestamp values are typically stored as longs (64-bit integers) expressing the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 by convention.</p>
<p>XML Schema, JSound and JSONiq follow the ISO 8601 standard, where lexical values look like so (with many parts optional): 2022-08-07T14:18:00.123456+02:00.</p>
<h4><span id="durations">Durations</span></h4><p>The lexical representation can vary, but there is a standard defined by ISO 8601 as well, starting with a P and prefixing sub-day parts with a T.<br>4 days, 3 hours, 2 minutes and 1.123456 seconds: P4DT3H2M1.123456S.</p>
<h4><span id="binary-data">Binary data</span></h4><p>Binary data is, logically, simply a sequence of bytes. There are two main lexical representations used in data: hexadecimal and base64. Hexadecimal expresses the data with two hexadecimal digits per byte. Base 64, formally, does the same but in the base 64, which “wastes” less lexical space in the text. It does so by encoding the bits six by six, encoding each sequence of six bits with one base-64 digit.</p>
<h4><span id="null">Null</span></h4><p>A schema can either allow, or disallow the null value.<br>XML also supports null values, but calls them “nil” and does so with a special attribute and no content rather than with a lexical representation</p>
<h3><span id="structured-types">Structured types</span></h3><h4><span id="lists">Lists</span></h4><p>Lists correspond to JSON arrays and are ordered sequences of (atomic or structured) values.</p>
<h4><span id="records">Records</span></h4><p>Records, or structs, correspond to JSON objects and are maps from strings to values.</p>
<h4><span id="maps">Maps</span></h4><p>Maps (not be confused with records, which are similar) are maps from any atomic value to any value, i.e., generalize objects to keys that are not necessarily strings (e.g., numbers, dates, etc).<br>With a schema, it is possible to restrict the type of the keys, as well as the type of the values. However, unlike records, the type of the values must be the same for all keys.</p>
<h4><span id="sets">Sets</span></h4><p>Sets are like lists, but without any specific ordering, and without duplicate values.</p>
<h4><span id="xml-elements-and-attributes">XML elements and attributes</span></h4><p>XML Schema stands apart from most other technologies and formats, in that it does not offer specific support for records and maps; it offers some limited support for lists, but considers them to be simple types, which are “inbetween” atomic types and structured types. n XML Schema, structure is obtained, instead, with elements and attributes, and the machinery for elements and attributes is highly specific to XML.</p>
<h4><span id="type-names">Type names</span></h4><p><img src="/2023/10/25/bigdata5/image.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h2><span id="sequence-types">Sequence types</span></h2><h3><span id="cardinality">Cardinality</span></h3><p>Many type system give options regarding the number of occurrences of items in a sequence.</p>
<h3><span id="collections-vs-nested-lists">Collections vs. nested lists</span></h3><p>A collection of items is on the outer level, and can be massively large (billions, trillions of items).</p>
<p>A list (or array) of items, however, usually refers to a nested structure, for example an array nested inside a document or object. Such lists of items are usually restricted in size for reasons of performance and scalability.</p>
<p>It is thus important to keep this subtle difference in mind, in particular, do not confuse a collection of integers with a collection that contains a single array of integers.</p>
<h2><span id="json-validation">JSON validation</span></h2><h3><span id="validating-flat-objects">Validating flat objects</span></h3><p>JSound is a schema language that was designed to be simple for 80% of the cases, making it particularly suitable in a teaching environment.It is independent of any programming language.JSON Schema is another technology for validating JSON documents. The available JSON Schema types are string, number, integer, boolean, null, array and object.</p>
<p>An example for a json document is like:<br>{ “name” : “Einstein”, “first” : “Albert”, “age” : 142 }<br>The JSound and the JSON Schema are as follows:<br>{ “name” : “string”, “first” : “string”, “age” : “integer” }</p>
<p>{ “type” : “object”, “properties” : { “name” : “string”, “first” : “string”, “age” : “number” } }.</p>
<p>The type system of JSON Schema is thus less rich than that of JSound, but extra checks can be done with so-called formats, which include date, time, duration, email, and so on including generic regular expressions.</p>
<h3><span id="requiring-the-presence-of-a-key">Requiring the presence of a key</span></h3><p>It is possible to require the presence of a key by adding an exclamation mark in JSound. The equivalent JSON Schema uses a “required” property associated with the list of required keys to express the same.</p>
<h3><span id="open-and-closed-object-types">Open and closed object types</span></h3><p>In the JSound compact syntax, extra keys are forbidden. The schema is said to be closed. There are ways to define JSound schemas to allow arbitrary additional keys (open schemas), with a more verbose syntax. Unlike JSound, in JSON Schema, extra properties are allowed by default. JSON Schema then allows to forbid extra properties with the “additionalProperties” property.</p>
<h3><span id="nested-structures">Nested structures</span></h3><p>{ “numbers” : [ “integer” ] }<br>Every schema can be given a name, turning into a type.<br>JSound allows for the definition not only of arbitrary array and object types, but also user-defined types.</p>
<h3><span id="primary-key-constraints-allowing-for-null-default-values">Primary key constraints, allowing for null, default values</span></h3><p>There are a few more features available in the compact JSound syntax (not in JSON Schema) with the special characters @, ? and =. The question mark (?) allows for null values.  The arobase (@) indicates that one or more fields are primary keys for a list of objects that are members of the same array. The equal sign (=) is used to indicate a default value that is automatically populated if the value is absent.</p>
<p>Note that validation only checks whether lexical values are part of the type’s lexical space.</p>
<h3><span id="accepting-any-values">Accepting any values</span></h3><p>Accepting any values in JSound can be done with the type “item”, which contains all possible values. In JSON Schema, in order to declare a field to accept any values, you can use either true or an empty object in lieu of the type. JSON Schema additionally allows to use false to forbid a field. </p>
<h3><span id="type-unions">Type unions</span></h3><p>In JSON Schema, it is also possible to combine validation checks with Boolean combinations. JSound schema allows defining unions of types with the vertical bar inside type strings, like so: “string|array”. </p>
<h3><span id="type-conjunction-exclusive-or-negation">Type conjunction, exclusive or, negation</span></h3><p>In JSON Schema only (not in JSound), it is also possible to do a conjunction (logical and), as well as exclusive or (xor), as well as negation.</p>
<h2><span id="xml-validation">XML validation</span></h2><h3><span id="simple-types">Simple types</span></h3><p>All elements in an XML Schema are in a namespace, the XML Schema namespace. It is recommended to stick to the prefix xs, or xsd, which is also quite popular. We do not recommend declaring the XML Schema namespace as a default namespace, because it can create confusion in several respects.</p>
<p>The list of predefined atomic types is the same as in JSound, except that in XML Schema, all these predefined types live in the XML Schema namespace and thus bear the prefix xs as well.</p>
<h3><span id="builtin-types">Builtin types</span></h3><p>XML Schema allows you to define user-defined atomic types, for example restricting the length of a string to 3 for airport codes, and then use it with an element.</p>
<h3><span id="complex-types">Complex types</span></h3><p>It is also possible to constrain structures and the element/attribute/text hierarchy with complex types applying to element nodes.<br>There are four main kinds of complex types:• complex content: there can be nested elements, but there can be no text nodes as direct children. • simple content: there are no nested elements: just text, but attributes are also possible. • empty content: there are neither nested elements nor text, but attributes are also possible. • mixed content: there can be nested elements and it can be intermixed with text as well.</p>
<h3><span id="attribute-declarations">Attribute declarations</span></h3><p>Finally, all types of content can additionally contain attributes. Attributes always have a simple type.</p>
<h3><span id="anonymous-types">Anonymous types</span></h3><p>Finally, it is not mandatory to give a name to all types. Be careful: if there is neither a type attribute nor a nested type declaration, then anything is allowed! </p>
<h3><span id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</span></h3><p>Finally, XML Schema documents are themselves XML documents, and can thus be validated against a “schema or schemas”, itself written as an XML Schema.This schema has the wonderful property of being valid against itself.</p>
<h2><span id="data-frames">Data frames</span></h2><h3><span id="heterogeneous-nested-datasets">Heterogeneous, nested datasets</span></h3><p>The beauty of the JSON data model is that, unlike the relational model and the CSV syntax, it supports nested, heterogeneous datasets, while also supporting as a particular case flat, homogeneous datasets.</p>
<h3><span id="dataframe-visuals">Dataframe visuals</span></h3><p>There is a particular subclass of semi-structured datasets that are very interesting: valid datasets, which are collections of JSON objects valid against a common schema, with some requirements on the considered schemas. The datasets belonging to this particular subclass are called data frames, or dataframes.</p>
<p>Specifically, for the dataset to qualify as a data frame, firstly, we forbid schemas that allow for open object types. secondly, we forbid schemas that allow for object or array values to be too permissive and allow any values. We, however, include schemas that allow for null values and/or absent values. Relational tables are data frames, while data frames are not necessarily relational tables. Data frames are a generalization of (normalized) relational tables allowing for (organized and structured) nestedness.</p>

<h2><span id="why-wide-column-stores">Why wide column stores</span></h2><p>A wide column store will be more tightly integrated with the parallel data processing systems.<br>wide column stores have a richer logical model than the simple key-value model behind object storage. wide column stores also handle very small values (bytes and kBs) well thanks to batch processing.</p>
<h2><span id="different-from-rdbms">different from RDBMS</span></h2><p>It does not have any data model for values, which are just arrays of bytes; since it efficiently handles values up to 10 MB, the values can be nested data in various formats, which breaks the first normal form; tables do not have a schema; there is no language like SQL, instead the API is on a lower level and more akin to that of a key-value store; tables can be very sparse, allowing for billions of rows and millions of columns at the same time; this is another reason why data stored in HBase is denormalized. </p>
<h2><span id="bigtable-and-hbase">BigTable and HBase</span></h2><h3><span id="rationale">Rationale</span></h3><p>HBase is an open-source equivalent to the BigTable as part of the Hadoop ecosystem.<br>The data model of HBase is based on the realization that joins are expensive, and that they should be avoided or minimized on a cluster architecture.</p>
<p>The second design principle underlying HBase is that it is efficient to store together what is accessed together. In the big picture, this is a flavor of batch processing, one of the overarching principles in Big Data. Batch processing reduces the impact of latency.</p>
<h3><span id="tables-and-row-ids">Tables and row IDs</span></h3><p>From an abstract perspective, HBase can be seen as an enhanced keyvalue store, in the sense that:a key is compound and involves a row, a column and a version;values can be larger (clobs, blobs), up to around 10 MB; keys are sortable. </p>
<p>A row ID is logically an array of bytes, although there is a library to easily create row ID bytes from specific primitive values. In HBase, the key identifying every cell consists of: the row ID, the column family, the column qualifier, the version.</p>
<h3><span id="column-families">Column families</span></h3><p>The other attributes, called columns, are split into so-called column families. This is a concept that does not exist in relational databases and that allows scaling the number of columns.</p>
<h3><span id="column-qualifiers">Column qualifiers</span></h3><p>Columns in HBase have a name (in addition to the column family) called column qualifier, however unlike traditional RDBMS, they do not have a particular type. Column qualifiers are arrays of bytes (rather than strings), and as for row IDs, there is a library to easily create column qualifiers from primitive values. Unlike the values which can be large arrays of bytes (blobs), it is important to keep column families and column qualifiers short, because as we will see, they are repeated a gigantic number of times on the physical layer.</p>
<h3><span id="versioning">Versioning</span></h3><p>HBase generally supports versioning, in the sense that it keeps track of the past versions of the data. As we will see, this is implemented by associating any value with a timestamp, also called version, at which it was created (or deleted).Users can also override timestamps with a value of their choice to have more control about versions.</p>
<h2><span id="logical-queries">Logical queries</span></h2><p>HBase supports four kinds of low-level queries: get, put, scan and delete. Unlike a traditional key-value store, HBase also supports querying ranges of row IDs and ranges of timestamps.</p>
<p>HBase offers a locking mechanism at the row level, meaning that different rows can be modified concurrently, but the cells in the same row cannot: only one user at a time can modify any given row.</p>
<h2><span id="physical-architecture">Physical architecture</span></h2><h3><span id="partitioning">Partitioning</span></h3><p>A table in HBase is physically partitioned in two ways: on the rows and on the columns. The rows are split in consecutive regions. Each region is identified by a lower and an upper row key, the lower row key being included and the upper row key excluded. A partition is called a store and corresponds to the intersection of a region and of a column family.<br><img src="/2023/10/17/bigdata4/image-1.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h3><span id="network-topology">Network topology</span></h3><p>HBase has exactly the same centralized architecture as HDFS. The HMaster and the RegionServers should be understood as processes running on the nodes, rather than the nodes themselves. The HMaster assigns responsibility of each region to one of the RegionServers. There is no need to attribute the responsibility of a region to more than one RegionServer at a time because, as we will see soon, fault tolerance is already handled on the storage level by HDFS. If a region grows too big, for example because of many writes in the same row ID interval, then the region will be automatically split by the responsible RegionServer. If a RegionServer has too many regions compared to other RegionServers, then the HMaster can reassign regions to other RegionServers.</p>
<h3><span id="physical-storage">Physical storage</span></h3><p>The store is, physically, nothing less than a set of cells. Each cell is thus handled physically as a key-value pair where the key is a (row ID, column family, column qualifier, version) tuple. All the cells within a store are eventually persisted on HDFS, in files that we will call HFiles.</p>
<p>An HFile is, in fact, nothing else than a (boring) flat list of KeyValues, one per cell. What is important is that, in an HFile, all these KeyValues are sorted by key in increasing order, meaning, first sorted by row ID, then by column family (trivially unique for a given store), then by column qualifier, then by version (in decreasing order, recent to old). This means that all versions of a given cell that are in the same HFile are located together, and one of the cells (within this HFile) is the latest. If we zoom in at the bit level, a KeyValue consists in four parts: The length of the keys in bits (this length is encoded on a constant, known number of bits) • The length of the value in bits (this length is encoded on a constant, known number of bits) • The actual key (of variable length) • The actual value (of variable length). Why do we not just store the key and the value? This is because their length can vary. If we do not know their length, then it is impossible to know when they stop just looking at the bits.<br><img src="/2023/10/17/bigdata4/image-2.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>KeyValues, within an HFile, are organized in blocks. But to not confuse them with HDFS blocks, we will call them HBlocks. HBlocks have a size of 64 kB, but this size is variable: if the last KeyValue goes beyond this boundary, then the HBlock is simply longer and stops whenever the last KeyValue stops. The HFile then additionally contains an index of all blocks with their key boundaries. This separate index is loaded in memory prior to reading anything from the HFile.</p>
<h3><span id="log-structured-merge-trees">Log-structured merge trees</span></h3><p>When accessing data, HBase needs to generally look everywhere for cells to potentially return: in every HFile, and in memory. As long as there is room in memory, freshly created cells are added in memory. At some point, the memory becomes full (or some other limits are reached). When this happens, all the cells need to be flushed to a brand new HFile. Upon flushing, all cells are written sequentially to a new HFile in ascending key order, HBlock by HBlock, concurrently building the index structure. When cells are added to memory, they are added inside a data structure that maintains them in sorted order (such as tree maps) and then flushing is a linear traversal of the tree.</p>
<p>What happens if the machine crashes and we lose everything in memory? We have a so-called write-ahead-log for this. Before any fresh cells are written to memory, they are written in sequential order (append) to an HDFS file called the HLog. There is one HLog per RegionServer. A full write-ahead-log also triggers a flush of all cells in memory to a new HFile. If there is a problem and the memory is lost, the HLog can be retrieved from HDFS and “played back” in order to repopulate the memory and recreate the sorting tree structure.</p>
<p>After many flushes, the number of HFiles to read from grows and becomes impracticable. For this reason, there is an additional process called compaction that takes several HFiles and outputs a single,merged HFile. Since the cells within each HFile are already sorted, this can be done in linear time, as this is essentially the merge part of the merge-sort algorithm. Compaction is not done arbitrarily but follows a regular, logarithmic pattern. When the memory is flushed again, an standard-size HFile is written and the two standard-size HFiles are immediately compacted to a double-size HFile.</p>
<h2><span id="additional-design-aspects">Additional design aspects</span></h2><h3><span id="bootstrapping-lookups">Bootstrapping lookups</span></h3><p>In order to know which RegionServer a client should communicate with to receive cells corresponding to a specific region, there is a main, big lookup table that lists all regions of all tables together with the coordinates of the RegionServer in charge of this region as well as additional metadata. </p>
<h3><span id="caching">Caching</span></h3><p>In order to improve latency, cells that are normally persisted to HFiles (and thus no longer in memory) can be cached in a separate memory region, with the idea of keeping in the cache those cells that are frequently accessed.</p>
<h3><span id="bloom-filters">Bloom filters</span></h3><p>HBase has a mechanism to avoid looking for cells in every HFile. This mechanism is called a Bloom filter. It is basically a black box that can tell with absolute certainty that a certain key does not belong to an HFile, while it only predicts with good probability (albeit not certain) that it does belong to it.</p>
<h3><span id="data-locality-and-short-circuiting">Data locality and short-circuiting</span></h3><p>When a RegionServer flushes cells to a new HFile, a replica of each (HDFS) block of the HFile is written, by the DataNode process living on the same machine as the RegionServer process, to the local disk. This makes accessing the cells in future reads by the RegionServer extremely efficient, because the RegionServer can read the data locally without communicating with the NameNode: this is known as short-circuiting in HDFS.</p>
<h2><span id="using-habse">using Habse</span></h2><p>After installing Hbase, we can use Hbase shell. There are some commands in hbase shell: get, scan.<br>We can use filters with scan to query and filter data.</p>
<h2><span id="exercises">exercises</span></h2><h3><span id="bloom-filter">bloom filter</span></h3><p>perfect hash function should have uniform probability.<br>all hash functions set a bit to 1 = collide at the same place: probability of a FP case<br>deleting only happens when compacting.</p>

CSV means comma-separated values. The main challenge with CSV files is that, in spite of a standard (RFC 4180), in practice there are many different dialects and variations, which limits interoperability. For example, another character can be used instead of the comma (tabulation, semi-colons, etc). Also, when a comma (or the special character used in its stead) needs to actually appear in a value, it needs to be escaped.</p>
<h2><span id="data-denormalization">Data denormalization</span></h2><p>Data denormalization makes a lot of sense in read-intensive scenarios in which not having to join brings a significant performance improvement.</p>
<p>The difference with CSV is that, in JSON, the attributes appear in every tuple, while in CSV they do not appear except in the header line. JSON is appropriate for data denormalization because including the attributes in every tuple allows us to drop the identical support requirement.</p>
<p>The generic name for denormalized data (in the same of heterogeneous and nested) is “semi-structured data”. Textual formats such as XML and JSON have the advantage that they can both be processed by computers, and can also be read, written and edited by humans. Another very important and characterizing aspect of XML and JSON is that they are standards: XML is a W3C standard. W3C, also known as the World Wide Web consortium, is the same body that also standardizes HTML, HTTP, etc. JSON is now an ECMA standard, which is the same body that also standardizes JavaScript.</p>
<p>Whichever syntax is used, they have in common the concept of well-formedness. A string is said to be well-formed if it belongs to the language. Concretely, when a document is well-formed XML, it means that it can be successfully opened by an editor as XML with no errors.</p>
<h2><span id="json">JSON</span></h2><p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation because the way it looks like originates from JavaScript syntax, however it is now living its own life completely independently of JavaScript. </p>
<p>JSON is made of exactly six building blocks: strings, numbers, Booleans, null, objects, and arrays. Strings are simply text. In JSON, strings always appear in double quotes. Obviously, strings could contain quotes and in order not to confuse them with the surrounding quotes, they need to be differentiated. This is called escaping and, in JSON, escaping is done with backslash characters ().</p>
<p>JSON generally supports numbers, without explicitly naming any types nor making any distinction between numbers apart from how they appear in syntax. The way a number appears in syntax is called a lexical representation, or a literal. JSON places a few restrictions: a leading + is not allowed. Also, a leading 0 is not allowed except if the integer part is exactly 0. </p>
<p>There are two Booleans, true and false. Arrays are simply lists of values. The concept of list is abstract and mathematical. The concept of array is the syntactic counterpart of a list. Objects are simply maps from strings to values. The concept of object is the syntactic counterpart of a map,i.e., an object is a physical representation of an abstract map that explicitly lists all string-value pairs. The keys of an object must be strings. The JSON standard recommends for keys to be unique within an object.</p>
<h2><span id="xml">XML</span></h2><p>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It resembles HTML, except that it allows for any tags and that it is stricter in what it allows. </p>
<p>XML’s most important building blocks are elements, attributes, text and comments. XML is a markup language, which means that content is “tagged”. Tagging is done with XML elements. An XML element consists of an opening tag, and a closing tag. What is “tagged” is everything inbetween the opening tag and the closing tag. ags consist of a name surrounded with angle brackets &lt; … &gt;, and the closing tag has an additional slash in front of the name. We use a convenient shortcut to denote the empty element with a single tag and a slash at the end. For example, \<person> is equal to<br>\<person>\</person>.<br>Unlike JSON keys, element names can repeat at will.</person></p>
<p>Attributes appear in any opening elements tag and are basically keyvalue pairs. Values can be either double-quoted or single-quoted. The key is never quoted, and it is not allowed to have unquoted values. Within the same opening tag, there cannot be duplicate keys.  Attributes can also appear in an empty element tag. Attributes can never appear in a closing tag. It is not allowed to create attributes that start with XML or xml, or any case combination.</p>
<p>Text, in XML syntax, is simply freely appearing in elements and without any quotes (attribute values are not text!). Within an element, text can freely alternate with other elements. This is called mixed content and is unique to XML. </p>
<p>Comments in XML look like so: \<!-- This is a comment -->. XML documents can be identified as such with an optional text declaration containing a version number and an encoding, like \&lt;?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?&gt;. The version is either 1.0 or 1.1. Another tag that might appear is the doctype declaration, like \&lt;!DOCTYPE person&gt;. </p>
<p>Remember that in JSON, it is possible to escape sequences with a backslash character. In XML, this is done with an ampersand (&amp;) character. There are exactly five possible escape sequences pre-defined in XML:<br><img src="/2023/10/11/bigdata3/image-1.png" alt="Alt text">. Escape sequences can be used anywhere in text, and in attribute values. At other places (element names, attribute names, inside comments), they will not be recognized.<br>There are a few places where they are mandatory:&amp; and &lt; MUST be escaped. ” and ‘ should also be escaped in quoted qttribute values. </p>
<p>Namespaces are an extension of XML that allows users to group their elements and attributes in packages, similar to Python modules, Java packages or C++ namespaces. A namespace is identified with a URI. A point of confusion is that XML namespaces often start with http://, but are not meant to be entered as an address into a browser. A namespace declaration is like: \<persons xmlns="http://www.example.com/persons">. If you remember, we saw that attributes starting with xml are forbidden, and this is because this is reserved for namespace declarations. What about documents that use multiple namespaces? This is done by associating namespaces with prefixes, which act as shorthands for a namespace. Then, we can use the prefix shorthand in every element that we want to have in this namespace.<br><img src="/2023/10/11/bigdata3/image-2.png" alt="Alt text"><br>So, given any element, it is possible to find its local name, its (possibly absent) prefix, and its (possibly absent) namespace. The triplet (namespace, prefix, localname) is called a QName</persons></p>
<p>Attributes can also live in namespaces, that is, attribute names are generally QNames. However, there are two very important aspects to consider. First, unprefixed attributes are not sensitive to default namespaces: unlike elements, the namespace of an unprefixed attribute is always absent even if there is a default namespace. Second, it is possible for two attributes to collide if they have the same local name, and different prefixes but associated with the same namespace (but again, we told you: do not do that!).</p>
