<h2><span id="markov-chain-monte-carlo-methods">Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods</span></h2><p>The key idea of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is to construct a Markov chain, which is efficient to simulate and has the stationary distribution p.</p>
<h3><span id="markov-chainsstationarityconvergence-markov-propertytime-homogeneous-markov-chains">Markov Chains(Stationarity,convergence), Markov property,time-homogeneous Markov chains</span></h3><p>Intuitively, the Markov property states that future behavior is independent of past states given the present state.</p>
<h3><span id="stationary-distributionaperiodicergodicityfundamental-theorem-of-ergodic-markov-chains">Stationary distribution,aperiodic,Ergodicity,Fundamental theorem of ergodic Markov chains</span></h3><p>After entering a stationary distribution π, a Markov chain will always remain in the stationary distribution.</p>
<p>It can be shown that there exists a unique stationary distribution π if the Markov chain is irreducible, that is, if every state is reachable from every other state with a positive probability when the Markov chain is run for enough steps.</p>
<p>Even if a Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution, it must not converge to it.</p>
<p>In words, a Markov chain is aperiodic iff for every state x, the transition graph has a closed path from x to x with length k for all k ∈ N greater than some k0 ∈ N.</p>
<p>A Markov chain is ergodic iff there exists a t ∈ N0 such that for any x, x′ ∈ S we have p(t)(x′ | x) &gt; 0.</p>
<p>A commonly used strategy to ensure that a Markov chain is ergodic is to add “self-loops” to every vertex in the transition graph.</p>
<p>An ergodic Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution π (with full support) irrespectively of the initial distribution q0. This naturally suggests constructing an ergodic Markov chain such that its stationary distribution coincides with the posterior distribution. If we then sample “sufficiently long”, Xt is drawn from a distribution that is “very close” to the posterior distribution.</p>

<h3><span id="elementary-sampling-methodsmetropolis-hastings-algorithmmetropolis-hastings-theorem-gibbs-sampling">Elementary Sampling Methods,Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm,Metropolis-Hastings theorem, Gibbs Sampling</span></h3><p>A popular example of a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is Gibbs sampling. </p>

Observe that the posterior distribution can always be interpreted as a Gibbs distribution as long as prior and likelihood have full support.</p>
<p>Langevin dynamics adapts the Gaussian proposals of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to search the state space in an “informed” direction. The simple idea is to bias the sampling towards states with lower energy, thereby making it more likely that a proposal is accepted. A natural idea is to shift the proposal distribution perpendicularly to the gradient of the energy function. The resulting variant of Metropolis-Hastings is known as the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) or Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC).</p>
<p>The HMC algorithm is an instance of Metropolis-Hastings which uses momentum to propose distant points that conserve energy, with high acceptance probability.</p>
<h3><span id="path">path</span></h3><p>target: show that the stationary distribution of a Markov chain coincides with the posterior distribution.<br>base: Detailed Balance Equation which shows that A Markov chain that satisfies the detailed balance equation with respect to π is called reversible with respect to π and if the Markov chain is reversible with respect to π then π is a stationary distribution. With posterior distribution p(x) = 1/Z q(x), substitute the posterior for π in the detailed balance equation, we can remove z, so we do not need to know the true posterior p to check that the stationary distribution of our Markov chain coincides with p, it suffices to know the finite measure q. However, until now, this does not allow us to estimate expectations over the posterior distribution. Note that although constructing such a Markov chain allows us to obtain samples from the posterior distribution, they are not independent. Thus, the law of large numbers and Hoeffding’s inequality do not apply, but there is a way to generalize the (strong) law of large numbers to Markov chains, which is Ergodic theorem. </p>
<p>Next we need to consider how to construct Markov chain with the goal of approximating samples from the posterior distribution p. One way is Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, in which we are given a proposal distribution and we use the acceptance distribution to decide whether to follow the proposal. Another way is Gibbs sampling. </p>
<p>MCMC techniques can be generalized to<br>continuous random variables / vectors. Observe that the posterior distribution can always be interpreted as a Gibbs distribution as long as prior and likelihood have full support.</p>

<p><img src="/2023/12/07/pai9/image-78.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Now, we cannot compute this derivative because we cannot compute the expectation. Firstly, the expectation is over the true value function which is unknown to us. Secondly, the expectation is over the transition model which we are trying to avoid in model-free methods. To resolve the first issue, analogously to TD-learning, instead of learning the true value function vπ which is unknown, we learn the bootstrapping estimate Vπ. To resolve the first issue, analogously to TD-learning, instead of learning the true value function vπ which is unknown, we learn the bootstrapping estimate Vπ. we will use a Monte Carlo estimate using a single sample. Recall that this is only possible because the transitions are conditionally independent given the state-action pair. </p>

<p><img src="/2023/12/07/pai9/image-80.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Therefore, TD-learning is essentially performing stochastic gradient descent using the TD-error as an unbiased gradient estimate.<br>Stochastic gradient descent with a bootstrapping estimate is also called stochastic semi-gradient descent.</p>
<h2><span id="value-function-approximation">Value Function Approximation</span></h2><p>Our goal for large state-action spaces is to exploit the smoothness properties5 of the value function to condense the representation. </p>
<h3><span id="heuristics">Heuristics</span></h3><p>The vanilla stochastic semi-gradient descent is very slow.<br>There are mainly two problems.<br>As we are trying to learn an approximate value function that depends on the bootstrapping estimate, this means that the optimization target is “moving” between iterations. In practice, moving targets lead to stability issues. One such technique aiming to “stabilize” the optimization targets is called neural fitted Q-iteration or deep Q-networks (DQN). DQN updates the neural network used for the approximate bootstrapping estimate infrequently to maintain a constant optimization target across multiple episodes. One approach is to clone the neural network and maintain one changing neural network (“online network”) for the most recent estimate of the Q-function which is parameterized by θ, and one fixed neural network (“target network”) used as the target which is parameterized by θold and which is updated infrequently.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/12/07/pai9/image-90.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>This technique is known as experience replay. Another approach is Polyak averaging where the target network is gradually “nudged” by the neural network used to estimate the Q function.</p>
<p>Now, observe that the estimates Q⋆ are noisy estimates of q⋆. The fact that the update rules can be affected by inaccuracies (i.e., noise in the estimates) of the learned Q-function is known as the “maximization bias”. Double DQN (DDQN) is an algorithm that addresses this maximization bias. Instead of picking the optimal action with respect to the old network, it picks the optimal action with respect to the new network. Intuitively, this change ensures that the evaluation of the target network is consistent with the updated Q-function, which makes it more difficult for the algorithm to be affected by noise. </p>

<h2><span id="policy-approximation">Policy Approximation</span></h2><p>Methods that find an approximate policy are also called policy search methods or policy gradient methods. Policy gradient methods use randomized policies for encouraging exploration.</p>

<p><img src="/2023/12/07/pai9/image-99.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>When using a neural network for the parameterization of the policy π, we can use automatic differentiation to obtain unbiased gradient estimates. However, it turns out that the variance of these estimates is very large. Using so-called baselines can reduce the variance dramatically.</p>
<p>The baseline essentially captures the expected or average value, providing a reference point. By subtracting this reference point, the updates become more focused on the deviations from the expected values, which can reduce the variance in these deviations.</p>

<p><img src="/2023/12/07/pai9/image-102.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Typically, policy gradient methods are slow due to the large variance in the score gradient estimates. Because of this, they need to take small steps and require many rollouts of a Markov chain. Moreover, we cannot reuse data from previous rollouts, as policy gradient methods are fundamentally on-policy.</p>
<h2><span id="actor-critic-methods">Actor-Critic Methods</span></h2><p>Actor-Critic methods reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates by using ideas from value function approximation. They use function approximation both to approximate value functions and to approximate policies.</p>
<h3><span id="advantage-function">Advantage Function</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/12/07/pai9/image-103.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Intuitively, the advantage function is a shifted version of the state-action function q that is relative to 0. It turns out that using this quantity instead, has numerical advantages.</p>

<p>Intuitively, ρθ(x) measures how often we visit state x when following policy πθ. It can be thought of as a “discounted frequency”. Importantly, ρθ is not a probability distribution, as it is not normalized to integrate to 1. Instead, ρθ is what is often called a finite measure. Therefore, eq. (12.57) is not a real expectation!</p>

<p>that the Q-function is an absolute quantity, whereas the advantage function is a relative quantity, where the sign is informative for the gradient direction. Intuitively, an absolute value is harder to estimate than the sign. Actor-Critic methods are therefore often implemented with respect to the advantage function rather than the Q-function. </p>
<h4><span id="gaegaae">GAE/GAAE</span></h4><p>Taking a step back, observe that the policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE generally have high variance in their gradient estimates. However, due to using Monte Carlo estimates of Gt, the gradient estimates are unbiased. In contrast, using a bootstrapped Q-function to obtain gradient estimates yields estimates with a smaller variance, but those estimates are biased. We are therefore faced with a bias-variance tradeoff. A natural approach is therefore to blend both gradient estimates to allow for effectively trading bias and variance. This leads to algorithms such as generalized advantage estimation (GAE/GAAE). </p>
<h4><span id="improving-sample-efficiencytrpoppo">Improving sample efficiency(TRPO/PPO)</span></h4><p>Actor-Critic methods generally suffer from low sample efficiency. One well-known variant that slightly improves the sample efficiency is trust-region policy optimization (TRPO). </p>
<p><img src="/2023/12/07/pai9/image-109.png" alt="Alt text"><br>Intuitively, taking the expectation with respect to the previous policy πθk , means that we can reuse data from rollouts within the same iteration. TRPO allows reusing past data as long as it can still be “trusted”. This makes TRPO “somewhat” off-policy. Fundamentally, though, TRPO is still an on-policy method. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is a heuristic variant of TRPO that often works well in practice.</p>
<h3><span id="off-policy-actor-critics">Off-policy Actor-Critics</span></h3><p>These algorithms use the reparameterization gradient estimates, instead of score gradient estimators. </p>
<h4><span id="ddpg">DDPG</span></h4><p>As our method is off-policy, a simple idea in continuous action spaces is to add Gaussian noise to the action selected by πθ — also known as Gaussian noise “dithering”. This corresponds to an algorithm called deep deterministic policy gradients.<br>This algorithm is essentially equivalent to Q-learning with function approximation (e.g., DQN), with the only exception that we replace the maximization over actions with the learned policy πθ.<br><img src="/2023/12/07/pai9/image-110.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Twin delayed DDPG (TD3) is an extension of DDPG that uses two separate critic networks for predicting the maximum action and evaluating the policy. This addresses the maximization bias akin to Double-DQN. TD3 also applies delayed updates to the actor network, which increases stability.</p>

<p>The algorithm that uses eq. (12.81) to obtain gradients for the critic and reparameterization gradients for the actor is called stochastic value gradients (SVG).</p>
<h3><span id="off-policy-actor-critics-with-entropy-regularization">Off-policy Actor-Critics with Entropy Regularization</span></h3><p>In practice, algorithms like SVG often do not explore enough. A key issue with relying on randomized policies for exploration is that they might collapse to deterministic policies. </p>
<p>A simple trick that encourages a little bit of extra exploration is to regularize the randomized policies “away” from putting all mass on a single action. This approach is known as entropy regularization and it leads to an analogue of Markov decision processes called entropy-regularized Markov decision process, where suitably defined regularized state-action value functions (so-called soft value functions) are used.</p>

In this chapter, we will begin by considering reinforcement learning with small state and action spaces. This setting is often called the tabular setting, as the value functions can be computed exhaustively for all states and stored in a table.</p>
<p>Clearly, the agent needs to trade exploring and learning about the environment with exploiting its knowledge to maximize rewards. In fact, Bayesian optimization can be viewed as reinforcement learning with a fixed state and a continuous action space: In each round, the agent plays an action, aiming to find the action that maximizes the reward.Another key challenge of reinforcement learning is that the observed data is dependent on the played actions.</p>
<h3><span id="trajectories">Trajectories</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai8/image-64.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Crucially, the newly observed states xt+1 and the rewards rt (across multiple transitions) are conditionally independent given the previous states xt and actions at. This independence property is crucial for being able to learn about the underlying Markov decision process. Notably, this implies that we can apply the law of large numbers (1.83) and Hoeffding’s inequality (1.87) to our estimators of both quantities.</p>
<p>The collection of data is commonly classified into two settings. In the episodic setting, the agent performs a sequence of “training” rounds (called episodes). In the beginning of each round, the agent is reset to some initial state. In contrast, in the continuous setting (or non-episodic,or online setting), the agent learns online. </p>
<h3><span id="control">control</span></h3><p>Another important distinction in how data is collected, is the distinction between on-policy and off-policy control. As the names suggest, on-policy methods are used when the agent has control over its own actions, in other words, the agent can freely choose to follow any policy. In contrast, off-policy methods can be used even when the agent cannot freely choose its actions. Off-policy methods are therefore able to make use of observational data.Off-policy methods are therefore more sample-efficient than on-policy methods. This is crucial, especially in settings where conducting experiments (i.e., collecting new data) is expensive.</p>
<p>On-Policy learning algorithms are the algorithms that evaluate and improve the same policy which is being used to select actions. Off-Policy learning algorithms evaluate and improve a policy that is different from Policy that is used for action selection.</p>
<p>To understand the difference between on-policy learning and off-policy learning one must first understand the difference between the behavior policy (i.e., sampling policy) and the update policy. The behavior policy is the policy an agent follows when choosing which action to take in the environment at each time step. The update policy is how the agent updates the Q-function. On-policy algorithms attempt to improve upon the current behavior policy that is used to make decisions and therefore these algorithms learn the value of the policy carried out by the agent, Off-policy algorithms learn the value of the optimal policy and can improve upon a policy that is different from the behavior policy. Determining if the update and behavior policy are the same or different can give us insight into whether or not the algorithm is on-policy or off-policy.</p>
<h2><span id="model-based-approaches">Model-based Approaches</span></h2><p>Approaches to reinforcement learning are largely categorized into two classes. Model-based approaches aim to learn the underlying Markov decision process. In contrast, model-free approaches learn the value function directly.</p>
<h3><span id="learning-the-underlying-markov-decision-process">Learning the Underlying Markov Decision Process</span></h3><p>A natural first idea is to use maximum likelihood estimation to approximate transition and reward function.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai8/image-65.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h3><span id="ε-greedy-algorithm">ε-greedy Algorithm</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai8/image-66.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>The key problem of ε-greedy is that it explores the state space in an uninformed manner. In other words, it explores ignoring all past experience. It thus does not eliminate clearly suboptimal actions.</p>
<h3><span id="rmax-algorithm">Rmax Algorithm</span></h3><p>A key principle in effectively trading exploration and exploitation is “optimism in the face of uncertainty”. Let us apply this principle to the reinforcement learning setting. The key idea is to assume that the dynamics and rewards model “work in our favor” until we have learned “good estimates” of the true dynamics and rewards. </p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai8/image-67.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>How many transitions are “enough”? We can use Hoeffding’s inequality to get a rough idea!</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai8/image-68.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h3><span id="challenges">challenges</span></h3><h2><span id="model-free-approaches">Model-free Approaches</span></h2><p>A significant benefit to model-based reinforcement learning is that it is inherently off-policy. That is, any trajectory regardless of the policy used to obtain it can be used to improve the model of the underlying Markov decision process. In the model-free setting, this not necessarily true.</p>
<h3><span id="on-policy-value-estimation">On-policy Value Estimation</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai8/image-71.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Note that to estimate this expectation we use a single(!) sample.However, there is one significant problem in this approximation. Our approximation of vπ does in turn depend on the (unknown) true value of vπ. The key idea is to use a bootstrapping estimate of the value function instead. That is, in place of the true value function vπ, we will use a “running estimate” Vπ. In other words, whenever observing a new transition, we use our previous best estimate of vπ to obtain a new estimate Vπ.</p>
<p>Crucially, using a bootstrapping estimate generally results in biased estimates of the value function. Moreover, due to relying on a single sample, the estimates tend to have very large variance. </p>
<h4><span id="td-learning">TD-learning</span></h4><p>The variance of the estimate is typically reduced by mixing new estimates of the value function with previous estimates using a learning rate αt. This yields the temporal-difference learning algorithm.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai8/image-70.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>TD-learning is a fundamentally on-policy method. That is, for the estimates Vπ to converge to the true value function vπ, the transitions that are used for the estimation must follow policy π. </p>
<h4><span id="sarsa">SARSA</span></h4><p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai8/image-69.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h3><span id="off-policy-value-estimation">Off-policy Value Estimation</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai8/image-72.png" alt="Alt text"><br>This adapted update rule explicitly chooses the subsequent action a′ according to policy π whereas SARSA absorbs this choice into the Monte Carlo approximation. The algorithm has analogous convergence guarantees to those of SARSA. Crucially, this algorithm is off-policy. As noted, the key difference to the on-policy TD-learning and SARSA is that our estimate of the Qfunction explicitly keeps track of the next-performed action. It does so for any action in any state.</p>

A key formalism for probabilistic plan ning in known environments are so-called Markov decision processes.<br><img src="/2023/11/17/pai7/image-50.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Our fundamental objective is to learn how the agent should behave to optimize its reward. In other words, given its current state, the agent should decide (optimally) on the action to play. Such a decision map — whether optimal or not — is called a policy.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai7/image-51.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai7/image-52.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>For the purpose of our discussion of Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning, we will focus on a very common reward called discounted payoff.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai7/image-53.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai7/image-54.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Because we assumed stationary dynamics, rewards, and policies, the discounted payoff starting from a given state x will be independent of the start time t.</p>
<h2><span id="bellman-expectation-equation">Bellman Expectation Equation</span></h2><p>Let us now see how we can compute the value function：</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai7/image-55.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>This equation is known as the Bellman expectation equation, and it shows a recursive dependence of the value function on itself. The intuition is clear: the value of the current state corresponds to the reward from the next action plus the discounted sum of all future rewards obtained from the subsequent states.</p>

<h2><span id="exploration-exploitation-dilemma">Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma</span></h2><p>In Bayesian optimization, we want to learn a model of f ⋆ and use this model to optimize f ⋆ simultaneously. These goals are somewhat contrary. Learning a model of f ⋆ requires us to explore the input space while using the model to optimize f ⋆ requires us to focus on the most promising well-explored areas. This trade-off is commonly known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma.</p>
<p>It is common to use a so-called acquisition function to greedily pick the next point to sample based on the current model.</p>
<h2><span id="online-learning-and-bandits">Online Learning and Bandits</span></h2><p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai6/image-40.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h3><span id="multi-armed-banditsmab">Multi-Armed Bandits(MAB)</span></h3><p>The “multi-armed bandits” (MAB) problem is a classical, canonical formalization of the exploration-exploitation dilemma. In the MAB problem, we are provided with k possible actions (arms) and want to maximize our reward online within the time horizon T. We do not know the reward distributions of the actions in advance, however, so we need to trade learning the reward distribution with following the most promising action.</p>
<p>Bayesian optimization can be interpreted as a variant of the MAB problem where there can be a potentially infinite number of actions (arms), but their rewards are correlated (because of the smoothness of the Gaussian process prior). Smoothness means that nearby points in the input space are likely to have similar function values. Because of the smoothness property inherent in the Gaussian process prior, Bayesian optimization can make informed decisions about where to explore next in the input space. The model can leverage information from previously evaluated points to predict the behavior of the objective function at unexplored points more effectively.</p>
<h3><span id="regret">Regret</span></h3><p>The key performance metric in online learning is the regret.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai6/image-41.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Achieving sublinear regret requires balancing exploration with exploitation. Typically, online learning (and Bayesian optimization) consider stationary environments, hence the comparison to the static optimum.</p>
<h3><span id="acquisition-functions">Acquisition Functions</span></h3><p>Throughout our description of acquisition functions, we will focus on a setting where we model $f^⋆$ using a Gaussian process which we denote by f. The methods generalize to other means of learning $f^⋆$ such as Bayesian neural networks.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai6/image-42.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>One possible acquisition function is uncertainty sampling. However, this acquisition function does not at all take into account the objective of maximizing $f^⋆$ and focuses solely on exploration. </p>
<p>Suppose that our model f of $f^⋆$  is well-calibrated, in the sense that the true function lies within its confidence bounds. Consider the best lower bound, that is, the maximum of the lower confidence bound. Now, if the true function is really contained in the confidence bounds, it must hold that the optimum is somewhere above this best lower bound.</p>
<p>Therefore, we only really care how the function looks like in the regions where the upper confidence bound is larger than the best lower bound. The key idea behind the methods that we will explore is to focus exploration on these plausible maximizers.</p>
<h3><span id="upper-confidence-bound">Upper Confidence Bound</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai6/image-43.png" alt="Alt text"><br>This acquisition function naturally trades exploitation by preferring a large posterior mean with exploration by preferring a large posterior variance.<br>This optimization problem is non-convex in general. However, we can use approximate global optimization techniques like Lipschitz optimization (in low dimensions) and gradient ascent with random initialization (in high dimensions). Another widely used option is to sample some random points from the domain, score them according to this criterion, and simply take the best one.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai6/image-44.png" alt="Alt text"><br>Observe that if the information gain is sublinear in T then we achieve sublinear regret and, in particular, converge to the true optimum. The term “sublinear” refers to a growth rate that is slower than linear. </p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai6/image-45.png" alt="Alt text"><br>Intuitively, to work even if the unknown function $f^⋆$  is not contained in the confidence bounds, we use βt to re-scale the confidence bounds to enclose $f^⋆$.</p>
<h3><span id="probability-of-improvement">Probability of Improvement</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai6/image-46.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Probability of improvement tends to be biased in favor of exploitation, as it prefers points with large posterior mean and small posterior variance.</p>
<h3><span id="expected-improvement">Expected Improvement</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai6/image-47.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Intuitively, expected improvement seeks a large expected improvement (exploitation) while also preferring states with a large variance (exploration).</p>
<h3><span id="thompson-sampling">Thompson Sampling</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai6/image-48.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Probability matching is exploratory as it prefers points with larger variance (as they automatically have a larger chance of being optimal), but at the same time exploitative as it effectively discards points with low posterior mean and low posterior variance. Unfortunately, it is generally difficult to compute π analytically given a posterior. Instead, it is common to use a sampling-based approximation of π.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/17/pai6/image-49.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>In many cases, the randomness in the realizations of  ̃ ft+1 is already sufficient to effectively trade exploration and exploitation.</p>
<h2><span id="model-selection">Model Selection</span></h2><p>Selecting a model of f ⋆ is much harder than in the i.i.d. data setting of supervised learning. There are mainly the two following dangers, • the data sets collected in active learning and Bayesian optimization are small; and • the data points are selected dependently on prior observations. This leads to a specific danger of overfitting. In particular, due to feedback loops between the model and the acquisition function, one may end up sampling the same point repeatedly.</p>
<p>Another approach that often works fairly well is to occasionally (according to some schedule) select points uniformly at random instead of using the acquisition function. This tends to prevent getting stuck in suboptimal parts of the state space.</p>
<h2><span id="difference-betwwen-active-learning-and-bayesian-optimization">difference betwwen active learning and Bayesian Optimization</span></h2><p>Problem Setting:<br>Active Learning: Active learning typically deals with supervised learning tasks where there is a large pool of unlabeled instances, and the algorithm decides which instances to query for labels to improve the model.<br>Bayesian Optimization: Bayesian optimization deals with optimization problems where the objective function is unknown, expensive to evaluate, and possibly noisy. It aims to find the global optimum with as few evaluations as possible.</p>
<p>Nature of Queries:<br>Active Learning: In active learning, the queries are often in the form of “Which instance should be labeled next?” The goal is to select instances that will most benefit the model’s learning process.<br>Bayesian Optimization: In Bayesian optimization, the queries are in the form of “What point should be evaluated next in the input space to maximize/minimize the objective function?” The goal is to efficiently explore the input space and find the optimal configuration.</p>
<p>Algorithmic Approaches:<br>Active Learning: Active learning involves various strategies such as uncertainty sampling, query-by-committee, and diversity sampling to select informative instances for labeling.<br>Bayesian Optimization: Bayesian optimization employs probabilistic surrogate models (often Gaussian processes) to model the unknown objective function. Acquisition functions guide the search to balance exploration and exploitation efficiently.</p>

Instead of relying solely on a fully labeled dataset for training, active learning involves an iterative process where the model actively selects the most informative instances from an unlabeled pool, queries an oracle (typically a human annotator), and adds the newly labeled instances to the training set. The model is then retrained on the expanded labeled dataset.</p>
<p>The key idea behind active learning is to strategically choose the most valuable instances for labeling, with the goal of improving the model’s performance while minimizing the number of labeled instances needed. This process is especially beneficial when obtaining labeled data is expensive or time-consuming.</p>
<p>Active learning strategies vary in how they select instances for labeling. Common strategies include uncertainty sampling (select instances where the model is uncertain), query-by-committee (select instances where different model hypotheses disagree), and diversity sampling (select instances to ensure diverse coverage of the input space).</p>
<h2><span id="conditional-entropy">Conditional Entropy</span></h2><p><img src="/2023/11/16/pai5/image-29.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Intuitively, the conditional entropy of X given Y describes our average surprise about realizations of X given a particular realization of Y, averaged over all such possible realizations of Y. In other words, conditional entropy corresponds to the expected remaining uncertainty in X after we observe Y.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/16/pai5/image-30.png" alt="Alt text"><br>That is, the joint entropy of X and Y is given by the uncertainty about X and the additional uncertainty about Y given X.</p>
<h2><span id="mutual-information">Mutual Information</span></h2><p><img src="/2023/11/16/pai5/image-31.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>In words, we subtract the uncertainty left about X after observing Y from our initial uncertainty about X. This measures the reduction in our uncertainty in X (as measured by entropy) upon observing Y.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/16/pai5/image-32.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Thus, the mutual information between X and Y can be understood as the approximation error (or information loss) when assuming that X and Y are independent.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/16/pai5/image-33.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Thus, the conditional mutual information corresponds to the reduction of uncertainty in X when observing Y, given we already observed Z.</p>
<p>Following our introduction of mutual information, it is natural to answer the question “where should I collect data?” by saying “wherever mutual information is maximized”.</p>
<h2><span id="submodularity-of-mutual-information">Submodularity of Mutual Information</span></h2><p><img src="/2023/11/16/pai5/image-34.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/16/pai5/image-35.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>That is, “adding” x to the smaller set A yields more marginal gain than adding x to the larger set B. In other words, the function F has “diminishing returns”. In this way, submodularity can be interpreted as a notion of “concavity” for discrete functions.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/16/pai5/image-36.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h2><span id="maximizing-mutual-information">Maximizing Mutual Information</span></h2><h3><span id="uncertainty-sampling">Uncertainty Sampling</span></h3><p><img src="/2023/11/16/pai5/image-37.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Therefore, if f is modeled by a Gaussian and we assume homoscedastic noise, greedily maximizing mutual information corresponds to simply picking the point x with the largest variance. This strategy is also called uncertainty sampling.</p>
<h3><span id="heteroscedastic-noise">Heteroscedastic Noise</span></h3><p>Uncertainty sampling is clearly problematic if the noise is heteroscedastic. If there are a particular set of inputs with a large aleatoric uncertainty dominating the epistemic uncertainty, uncertainty sampling will continuously choose those points even though the epistemic uncertainty will not be reduced substantially.<br><img src="/2023/11/16/pai5/image-38.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Thus, we choose locations that trade large epistemic uncertainty with large aleatoric uncertainty. Ideally, we find a location where the epistemic uncertainty is large, and the aleatoric uncertainty is low, which promises a significant reduction of uncertainty around this location.</p>

<p>Intuitively, the Markov property states that future behavior is independent of past states given the present state.</p>
<p>Markov chains can be classified into different types based on their behavior. These classifications include time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, irreducible Markov chains, and periodic and aperiodic Markov chains.</p>
<p>We restrict our attention to time-homogeneous Markov chains. That is, the transition probabilities do not change over time, which can be characterized by a transition function.</p>
<p>Irreducible Markov chains are those in which every state can be reached from any other state, while periodic Markov chains exhibit a repeating pattern in their states. On the other hand, aperiodic Markov chains do not exhibit any regular pattern in their states. If there is no fixed period at which the probabilities return to the starting values, the chain is classified as aperiodic. Aperiodic Markov chains often display a more complex and unpredictable behavior compared to periodic ones.</p>

<p>This result is the fundamental reason for why Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are possible. In practice, one observes that Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have a so-called “burn-in” time during which the distribution of the Markov chain does not yet approximate the posterior distribution well. Typically, the first t0 samples are therefore discarded. It is not clear in general how T and t0 should be chosen such that the estimator is unbiased, rather they have to be tuned. </p>
