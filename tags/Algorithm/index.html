<p>Turing reduction is a type of reduction that is stronger than Karp reduction. A problem A is Turing-reducible to problem B if there exists a Turing machine that can solve problem A by making a polynomial number of calls to a black-box subroutine for problem B. In other words, if we can use an algorithm for problem B to solve problem A, then A is Turing-reducible to B. Turing reduction preserves the complexity class of a problem, meaning that if A is Turing-reducible to B and B is in a certain complexity class, then A is also in that complexity class.</p>
<p>Karp reduction, also known as polynomial-time reduction, is a weaker form of reduction than Turing reduction. A problem A is Karp-reducible to problem B if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that can transform any instance of problem A into an instance of problem B such that the answer to the transformed instance is the same as the answer to the original instance of problem A. In other words, if we can use an algorithm for problem B to solve a transformed version of problem A in polynomial time, then A is Karp-reducible to B. Karp reduction preserves the complexity class up to polynomial factors, meaning that if A is Karp-reducible to B and B is in a certain complexity class, then A is also in that complexity class up to polynomial factors.</p>

<h2><span id="np-problem">NP problem</span></h2><p>We do not know of polynomial-time algorithms for these problems, and we cannot prove that no<br>polynomial-time algorithm exists. </p>
<p>NP stands for Nondeterministic Polynomial time.</p>
<p>NP is a set of problems that there is a polynomial-time algorithm that verify if a solution to the problem is correct.<br>Note that showing that a problem is in NP does not mean that the problem can be solved in polynomial time. It only means that a proposed solution can be verified in polynomial time.</p>
<p>All problems in P are also in NP, we do not know if P&#x3D;NP.</p>
<h2><span id="np-hardness">NP-hardness</span></h2><p>We say that a problem Y is NP-hard if every problem in NP can be Karp-reduced to Y. To prove NP-hardness for Y we only have to find<br>one other NP-hard problem X and reduce X to Y.</p>
<h2><span id="np-complete-problem">NP-complete problem</span></h2><p>A large class of problems in this “gray area” has been characterized,<br>and it has been proved that they are equivalent in the following sense: a polynomial-time algorithm for any one of them would imply the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm for all of them. These are the NP-complete problems.</p>
<p>Every problem in NP can be reduced to X. We will call such an X an NP-complete problem.</p>
<p>To prove a problem is np-complete, we need to prove it lies in Np and it is np-hard. In NP is proved by verifying the solution in polynomial time. Np-hard is proved by using Karp-reduction from known NP-hard problem.</p>
<p>the NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in NP</p>
